Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSI) project - Leveraging AI for improving remote interactions.,FDA,CDER/Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ),"This project aims to improve four major areas identified by FDA, including transcription, translation, document and evidence management, and co-working space. Automatic speech recognition has been widely used in many applications. Its cutting-edge technology is transformer-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model, which is trained to generate transcripts autoregressively and has been fine-tuned on certain datasets. Using pre-trained language models directly may not be suitable because they might not work properly with different accents and specialized regulatory and scientific terminologies. This is because the models were trained on a specific type of data and may not be able to handle data that is significantly different from what they were trained on. To address this, researchers plan to manually read a set of video/audio to obtain their true transcripts, upon which they fine-tune the model to make it adapt to this new domain. Machine translation converts a sequence of text from one language to another. Researchers usually use a method called ""seq2seq,"" where original text is codified into a language that a computer can understand. Then, we use this code to generate the translated version of the text. It's like a translator who listens to someone speak in one language and then repeats what they said in another language. Similarly, it is not appropriate to directly apply the existing pre-trained seq2seq models, because (a) some languages used in the FDA context might not exist in existing models. (b) domain specific terms used in FDA are very different from general human languages. To tackle these challenges, models are trained for some unusual languages and fine-tune pre-trained models for major languages. For both situations, researchers prepare high-quality training set labeled by experts. University of Maryland CERSI (M-CERSI) plans to build a system to manage different documents and evidence, by implementing three sub-systems: (a) document classifier, (b) video/audio classifier, and (c) an interactive middleware that connects the trained model at the backend and the input at the frontend. With this, all documents created during co-working can be shared and accessed by all participants.",Initiation,3/1/2023,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,Contracted,Yes,

Onboarding of EHR data partners ,FDA,CDER/Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE),"In the currently proposed project (DI6), structured fields from EHRs and linked claims data from two identified commercial data partners will be converted to the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM). The SCDM is an organizing CDM that preserves the original information from a data source and has been successfully used in the Sentinel system for over a decade. While originally built for claims data, SCDM was expanded in 2015 to accommodate some information commonly found in EHRs in separate clinical data tables to capture laboratory test results of interest and vital signs. We selected the SCDM over other CDMs because data formatted in the SCDM enables analyses that can leverage the standardized active risk identification and analysis (ARIA) tools. Operationally, both Data Partners will share SCDM transformed patient-level linked EHR-claims data with the IC after quality assessments are passed. This is a substantial advantage in this early stage of understanding how to optimally analyze such data. It will allow Sentinel investigators to directly work with the data, adapt existing analytic programs, and test algorithms. In sum, transformation of structured data from the proposed sources to SCDM format will be a key first step for potential future incorporation of these Data Partners into Sentinel to provide access to EHR-claims linked data for >10 million patients, which will be critical to meet the need identified in the 5-year Sentinel System strategic plan of 2019.",Initiation,10/1/2022,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,Contracted,Yes,

Profiles to Identify Data Anomalies",FDA,CDER/Office of Translational Sciences/Office of Biostatistics,"In efforts to detect data anomalies under ANDA, Office of Biostatistics, Division of Biometrics VIII created an R shiny application, DABERS (Data Anomalies in BioEquivalence R Shiny) to support OSIS and OGD. Despite its demonstrated effectiveness, a major drawback is that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be too complicated to describe with a single statistic. Indeed, the current practice offers no practical guidelines regarding how similar PK profiles from different subjects can be in order to be considered valid. This makes it difficult to assess the adequacy of data to be accepted for an ANDA and requires additional information requests to applicants. This project will address the current gap in identifying the data anomalies and potential data manipulations by use of state-of-the-art statistical methods, specifically focusing on machine learning and data augmentation. The purpose of the project is twofold.  First, from a regulatory perspective, our project will provide a data driven method that can model complex patterns of PK data to identify potential data manipulations under an ANDA.

Development of virtual animal models to simulate animal study results using Artificial Intelligence (AI) ,FDA,NCTR,"Testing data from animal models provides crucial evidence for the safety evaluation of chemicals. These data have been an essential component in regulating drug, food, and chemical safety by regulatory agencies worldwide including FDA. As a result, a wealth of animal data is available from the public domain and other sources. As the toxicology community and regulatory agencies move towards a reduction, refinement, and replacement (3Rs principle) of animal studies, we proposed an AI-based generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to learn from existing animal studies so that it can generate animal data for new and untested chemicals without conducting further animal experiments. The FDA has developed guidelines and frameworks to modernize toxicity assessment with alternative methods, such as the FDA Predictive Toxicology Roadmap and the Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND).

Prediction of adverse events from drug - endogenous ligand - target networks generated using 3D-similarity and machine learning methods.,FDA,NCTR,"Excluding areas of the biochemical space near activity cliffs [1], molecular similarity [2] has long proven to be an outstanding tool in virtual screening [3], absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) [4], drug design [5] and toxicology [6]. Among these, the toxicological response is the most challenging task due to its immense complexity involving multiple pathways and protein targets. Although many adverse drug reactions (ADRs) result from genetic polymorphisms and factors such as the patient's medical history and the treatment dosage and regimen, on a fundamental level all ADRs are initiated by the binding of a drug molecule to a target, whether intended (therapeutic target) or non-intended (off-target interactions with promiscuous proteins) [7]. While molecular similarity approaches designed to identify off-target interaction sites have been explored since the late 2000s [8, 9], most have been focused on drug design, repurposing and more generally, efficacy, whereas relatively few have been applied to toxicology [10, 11].
Since there are multiple approaches to molecular similarity (structural, functional, whole molecule, pharmacophore, etc. [12]), the performance of any of the above applications depends strongly on the metrics by which similarity is quantified. For the past 10 years, DSB has been working on creating a universal molecular modeling approach utilizing unique three-dimensional fingerprints encoding both the steric and electrostatic fields governing the interactions between ligands and receptors. It has been demonstrated that these fingerprints could quantify reliably both the structural and functional similarities between molecules [13, 14] and their application for prediction of adverse events from AI generated drug - endogenous ligand - target networks could provide new insights into yet unknown mechanisms of toxicity.",Initiation,,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
Predictive toxicology models of drug placental permeability using 3D-fingerprints and machine learning,FDA,NCTR,"The human placenta plays a pivotal role in fetal growth, development, and fetal exposure to chemicals and therapeutics. The ability to predict placental permeability of chemicals during pregnancy is an important factor that can inform regulatory decisions related to fetal safety and clinical trials with women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). The human placenta contains transport proteins, which facilitate the transfer of various endogenous substances and xenobiotics. Several mechanisms allow this transfer: i) passive diffusion, ii) active transport, iii) facilitated diffusion, iv) pinocytosis, and v) phagocytosis. Among these, passive and active transport are the two major routes. Small, non-ionized, highly lipophilic drugs cross the placenta via passive diffusion; however, relatively large molecules (MW > 500 Da) with low lipophilicity are carried by transporters. While prediction of the ability of drugs to cross the placenta via diffusion is straight-forward, the complexity of molecular interactions between drugs and transporters has proven to be a challenging problem to solve. Virtually, all QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) published to date model small datasets (usually not exceeding 100 drugs) and utilize weak validation strategies [1-5].
In this proposal, 3D-molecular similarities of endogenous placental transporter ligands to known drug substrates will be used to identify the most likely mode of drug transportation (active/passive) and build predictive, quantitative and categorical 3D-SDAR models by linking their molecular characteristics to placental permeability. Permeability data will be collected via mining the literature, the CDER databases, and conducting empirical assessments using in vitro NAMs with confirmation using rodent models.

Opioid agonists/antagonists knowledgebase (OAK) to assist review and development of analgesic products for pain management and opioid use disorder treatment,FDA,NCTR,"The number of deaths caused by opioid overdose in the United States has been increasing dramatically for the last decade. misuse and abuse continue at alarmingly high rates. Opioid use disorder (OUD) often starts with use of prescription opioid analgesics. Therefore, the development of abuse-deterrent analgesic products may significantly impact the trajectory of the opioid crisis. In addition, FDA is making new efforts to support novel product innovation for pain management and the treatment of OUD to combat this opioid crisis. 
Opioid agonists bind and activate opioid receptors to decrease calcium influx and  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), leading to hyperpolarization that inhibits pain transmission. Opioid antagonists bind and inhibit or block opioid receptors. Both opioid agonists and antagonists are used in drug products for pain management and treatment of opioid addiction. An opioid agonists/antagonists knowledgebase (OAK) would be useful for FDA reviewers to inform evaluation and to assist development of analgesics and of additional treatments for OUD.
To create a comprehensive OAK, we propose to curate the experimental data on opioid agonist/antagonist activity from the public domain, experimentally test some 2800 drugs in functional opioid receptor assays using quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) platform, and develop and validate in silico models to predict opioid agonist/antagonist activity. The created OAK knowledgebase could be used for retrieving experimental opioid agonist/antagonist activity data and the related experimental protocols. For chemicals without experimental data, read-across methods could be used to find similar chemicals in OAK to estimate the opioid agonist/antagonist activity, and the in silico models in OAK could be used to predict the opioid agonist/antagonist activity.

Therefore, detecting androgenic activity of drugs and other FDA regulated chemicals is critical for evaluation of drug safety and assessment of chemical risk. There is a large amount of androgenic activity data in the public domain, which could be an asset for the scientific community and regulatory science. However, the data are distributed across different and diverse sources and stored in different formats, limiting the use of the data in research and regulation. Therefore, a comprehensive, reliable resource to provide open access to the data and enable modeling and prediction of androgenic activity for untested chemicals is in urgent need. This project will develop a high-quality open access Molecules with Androgenic Activity Resource (MAAR) including data and predictive models fully compliant with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.  MAAR can be used to facilitate research on androgenic activity of chemicals and support regulatory decision making concerning efficacy and safety evaluation of drugs and chemicals in the FDA regulated products.",Implementation,11/6/2020,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) for FDA labeling documents,FDA,NCTR,"FDA has historically generated and continues to generate a variety of documents during the product-review process, which are typically unstructured text and often not follows the use of standards. Therefore, analysis of semantic relationships plays a vital role to extract useful information from the FDA documents to facilitate the regulatory science research and improve FDA product review process. The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an unprecedent opportunity to analyze the semantic text data by using the language models that are trained with large biomedical corpus. This study is to assess the AI based NLP for the FDA documents with a focus on the FDA labeling documents. Specifically, we will apply the publicly available language models (e.g., BERT and BioBERT) to the FDA drug labeling documents available from the FDA Label tool that manages over 120K labeling documents including over 40K Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products. We will investigate three areas of AI applications that are important to the regulatory science research: (1) the interpretation and classification of drug properties (e.g., safety and efficacy) with AI reading, (2) text summarization to provide highlights of labeling sections, (3) automatic anomaly analysis (AAA) for signal identification, and (4) information retrieval with Amazon-like Questions/Answer. We will compare the AI based NLP with MedDRA based approach whenever possible for drug safety and efficacy. The study will provide a benchmark for fit-for-purpose application of the public language models to the FDA documents and, moreover, the outcome of the study could provide a scientific basis to support the future development of FDALabel tool which is widely used in CDER review process.",Implementation,5/14/2021,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
Informing selection of drugs for COVID-19 treatment by big data analytics and artificial intelligence,FDA,NCTR,"The pandemic of COVID-19 is the biggest global health concern currently. As of July 11, 2020, more than 12 million people have been tested positive of SARS-COV-2 virus infection and more than half million deaths have been caused by COVID-19 in the world. Currently, no vaccines and/or drugs have been proved to be effective to treat COVID-19. Therefore, many drug products on the market are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. However, sufficient evidence is needed to determine that the repurposed drugs are safe and effective. Therefore, safety information on the drugs  selected for repurposing purpose is important. The proposed project aims to mine adverse drug events using artificial intelligence and big data analytics in the public domain including the agency's database, public databases, and social media data for the drugs to be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide detailed adverse event information that can be used to facilitate safety evaluation for drugs repurposed for the treatment COVID-19. The detailed adverse event information will be used to develop recommendations for selecting the right drugs for repurposing efforts and for help select the appropriate COVID-19 patients and thus better to combat the pandemic.",Implementation,3/27/2021,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
Towards Explainable AI: Advancing Predictive Modeling for Regulatory Use,FDA,NCTR,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad discipline of training machines to think and accomplish complex intellectual tasks like humans. It learns from existing data/information to predict future outcomes, distill knowledge, offer advices, or plan action steps. The rise of AI has offered both opportunities and challenges to FDA in two aspects: (1) how to assess and evaluate marketed AI-centric products and (2) how to implement AI methods to improve the agency's operation. One of the key aspects of both regulatory applications is to understand the underlying features driving the AI performance and to the extension of its interpretability in the context of application.  
 
Different from the statistical evaluation (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), model interpretability assessment lacks quantitative metrics. In most cases, the assessment tends to be subjective, where prior knowledge is often used as a ground-truth to explain the biological relevance of underlying features, e.g., whether the biomarkers featured by the model are in accordance with the existing findings. In reality, there is a trade-off between statistical performance and interpretability among different AI algorithms, and understanding the difference will improve the context of use of AI technologies in regulatory science.  

For that, we will investigate representative AI methods, in terms of their performance and interpretability, first through benchmark datasets that have been well-established in the research community, then extended to clinical/pre-clinical datasets. This project will provide basic parameters and offer an insightful guidance on developing explainable AI models to facilitate the real-world decision making in regulatory settings.",Implementation,3/27/2021,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
Identification of sex differences on prescription opioid use (POU)-related cardiovascular risks by big data analysis,FDA,NCTR,"1) Prescription opioid use (POU) varies among patient population subgroups, such as gender, age, and ethnicity. POU can potentially cause various adverse effects in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, and central nervous systems. Important sex differences have been observed in POU-associated cardiac endpoints. Currently, systematic knowledge is lacking for risk factors associated with the increased cardiotoxicity of POU in women. 2) Currently, the FDA utilizes two methods of analysis for data mining, the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) to identify significant statistical associations between products and adverse events (AEs). These methods are not applicable when two or more reporting measures (e.g. gender, age, race, etc.) must be considered and compared. In this study, a novel statistical model will be developed to detect the safety signals when gender is considered as the third variable. Safety signals will then be detected and compared from combined multiple-layered real-world evidence in the form of EHRs from diverse sources. Sex-dependent differences in risk factors for cardiotoxicity from POU will be identified and analyzed using big data methods and AI-related tools. 3) The proposed project addresses the first of four priority areas of FDA's 2018 Strategic Policy Roadmap: Reduce the burden of addiction crises that are threatening American families, and two priority areas of Women's Health Research Roadmap: Priority Area 1: Advance Safety and Efficacy, and Priority Area 5: Expand Data Sources and Analysis. The results may provide information and knowledge to help the FDA drug reviewers and physicians be aware of sex differences to certain POU drugs and combinations of POU with other prescription drugs, therefore, preventing or reducing risk of the POU drug-induced CVD in women.",Development and Acquisition,9/7/2021,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
NCTR/DBB-CDER/OCS collaboration on A SafetAI Initiative to Enhance IND Review Process ,FDA,NCTR,"The development of animal-free models has been actively investigated and successfully demonstrated as an alternative to animal-based approaches for toxicity assessments.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) have been the central engine in this paradigm shift to identify safety biomarkers from non-animal assays or to predict safety outcomes solely based on chemical structure data. AI is a computer system or algorithm that has the ability to learn from existing data to foresee the future outcome. ML, a subset of AI, has been specifically studied to make predictions for adverse drug reactions. Deep Learning (DL) is arguably the most advanced approach in ML which frequently outperforms other types of ML approaches (or conventional ML approaches) for the study of drug safety and efficacy. DL usually consists of multiple layers of neural networks to mimic the cognitive behaviors associated with the human brain learning and problem-solving process to solve data intensive problems. Among many studies using AI/ML, DL has become a default algorithm to consider due to its superior performance. This proposal will apply DL to flag safety concerns regarding drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and carcinogenicity during the IND review process.",Initiation,6/3/2022,,,hhs.caio@hhs.gov,In-house,Yes,
