## NLP on GFE testing
### AI contracts

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the ACF Data Surge Teamâ€™s project, titled `NLP on GFE Testing`. 

Project Overview: This project comprises a series of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to various NLP and machine learning tasks on a contract dataset. The notebooks serve different functions, including filtering the dataset for the last five years to identify AI-related keywords and visualizing word frequency through word clouds. Text preprocessing and summarization are conducted using the BART model, while topic modeling is achieved with NLTK and Gensim, followed by the LDA model to display and assign dominant topics. URL processing and file downloads are handled using a headless Firefox WebDriver, and AI techniques are clustered and summarized using LLMs like BART, phi3, and llama3. Additionally, text extraction from PDFs and Word files is performed for keyword identification and summarization. Another notebook focuses on extracting keywords and performing sentiment analysis on PDFs, saving results to a JSON file. The project also includes a notebook that applies machine learning models to a COVID dataset, simulating various scenarios and noting computational loads. Each notebook is tailored to specific tasks, offering a comprehensive approach to analyzing and understanding the contract dataset.
