If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. h.

If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. h.

(1) Offers received from entities that are not certified SDVOSBs and listed in the SBA certification database at the time of offer shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a certified SDVOSB listed in the SBA certification database who is eligible at the time of submission of offer(s) and at the time of award. (3) The requirements in this clause apply to any contract, order, or subcontract where the firm receives a benefit or preference from its designation as an SDVOSB, including set-asides, sole source awards, and evaluation preferences. (c) Representation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database are considered eligible to receive award of a resulting contract. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible and certified SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 13 CFR 121, 125, and 128, and VAAR subpart 819.70. (d) Agreement/LOS certification. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size, and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting (LOS) requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required LOS certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219 75 or 852.219 76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/ VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract. (2)Â Supplies/products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract. (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CFR 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements. (3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. (4) Special trade construction contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. (5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB subcontractor must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be certified and listed in the SBA certification database to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e)Â Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period.Â An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: __By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or X_By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 128.402 and the managing joint venture partner makes the representations under paragraph (c) of this clause. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g) Precedence. The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpart 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h) Misrepresentation. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company s SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406 2 Causes for Debarment).

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED; AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT (I.E. STANDARD FORM) WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2024-03. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the requirement is 334310 – Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing / Television (TV) Sets Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 750 employees. This is a 100% small business set-aside. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized. Note: The Small Business Administration (SBA) maintains an active non-manufacturer rule class waiver for the aforementioned NAICS code 334310 – Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing / Television (TV) Sets Manufacturing.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION The High Performance Computing and Visualization Group (HPCVG), is located in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Division (ACMD) in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Group develops novel algorithms and implementations for parallel and distributed computation, as well as innovative techniques for immersive scientific visualization in a variety of local and distributed hardware environments. They also develop and utilize techniques and tools of mathematical analysis, parallel and distributed computing, machine learning, and visualization to improve measurement science, including the extension of traditional measurement science to the virtual world. This is all in support of the NIST mission: “To promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.” HPCVG owns and operates a CAVE (CAVE Automatic Visualization Environment) for its immersive visualization work at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD site.  A CAVE is a real-time hardware system that enables the user to see perspective-based true 3D images. For this to function correctly, the hardware system must be designed with real-time capability that enables viewing of real-time images. This Immersive Visualization Environment (IVE), along with the software that the Group develops, is on a critical path for all research in the Group. Its role is critical in HPCVG’s High Performance Computing work as it serves to speed code development and enable quick checking for errors as well as validation tests. It enables the visualization, measurement on visualizations, and analysis of results. This has led to solving critical outstanding problems in industry and contributing to the creation of standard reference materials and data. For example, it played a crucial role in the development of the standard reference materials for cement paste, mortar, and concrete. The CAVE has come to the end of its life as the display system can no longer be maintained. In order to ensure continuity of research efforts and to keep pace with the rapid advancement of technology in this area, it is important that the IVE be upgraded. NIST requires an upgrade to the IVE/CAVE on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus with newer display technology. Higher resolution and more complex data visualizations require a higher resolution and brighter display system with collaborative visualization capability. NIST has identified that a Direct View Light Emitting Diodes (LED) display system would offer a higher resolution and brighter display compared to its existing projection-based visualization system. Furthermore, a Direct View LED system would also be able to support dual view stereoscopic visualization where both users would have their own unique view angle of the visualization.  Thus, NIST a dual-view display system, as described in the attached Specifications.

By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible and certified SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 13 CFR 121, 125, and 128, and VAAR subpart 819.70. (d) Agreement/LOS certification. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size, and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting (LOS) requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required (LOS) certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract. (2) Supplies/products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract. (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CFR 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements. (3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. (4) Special trade construction contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database. (5) Subcontracting. An SDVOSB subcontractor must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be certified and listed in the SBA certification database to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e) Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period. An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: [Contracting Officer check as appropriate.] X By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or ____ By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 128.402 and the managing joint venture partner makes the representations under paragraph (c) of this clause. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g) Precedence. The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpart 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Veteran Small Business Certification Program, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h) Misrepresentation. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company s SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

(d) Agreement/LOS certification. When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size, and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting (LOS) requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only certified SDVOSBs listed in the SBA certification database (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required LOS certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219 75 or 852.219 76 as applicable).

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: Innovators at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), in collaboration with Oceaneering and The Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, have developed the Split-Ring Torque Sensor (SRTS), a device that uses optical sensors to measure the position, velocity, and torque of a rotating system. The SRTS was created for use in NASA's X1 robotic exoskeleton, an in-space, wearable exercise machine designed to supply resistance against leg movement for NASA astronauts in future missions. The X1 exoskeleton implements the SRTS in its belt-drive series elastic actuator (SEA) and provides a lower profile and lower weight system than competing designs. The SRTS offers greater flexibility in tailoring for specific applications and requirements. In addition to its applications in robotics, the SRTS has potential uses in medical fields including prosthetics, aerospace & defense applications, automotive applications, testing & measurement, and industrial markets. To express interest in this opportunity, please submit a license application through NASA’s Automated Technology Licensing Application System (ATLAS) by visiting https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/MSC-TOPS-81 If you have any questions, please e-mail NASA’s Technology Transfer Program at Agency-Patent-Licensing@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this SAM.gov notice and your preferred contact information.

(4)Â Special trade construction contractors.Â In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5)Â Subcontracting.Â An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e)Â Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period.Â An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: [Contracting Officer check as appropriate.] __By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or __By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f)Â Joint ventures.Â A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g)Â Precedence.Â The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpartÂ 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h)Â Misrepresentation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. However, it is the policy of VA to forgo collection of liquidated damages in the event the contractor provides payment of actual damages in an amount determined to be adequate by the agency. BAA for contractor is required and will be on file. VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security APPENDIX C GENERAL Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION The term security incident means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a security incident as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); Description of the event, including: date of occurrence; data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: Notification; One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; Data breach analysis; Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. TRAINING Per VA Handbook 6500.6, Contract Security Appendix C, All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems; Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training; Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.] The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders.  In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.   The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror’s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract.  NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf  Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI)  In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition.  The nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.   Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.   The Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.)  The Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts.  This effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products.  A link to the NASA’s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf  Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions:  1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?   2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.  3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)?  4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP?  NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA’s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA’s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA’s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA’s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI.  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility  In support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of ""equity."" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  NASA seeks input in the following areas:  1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged?  2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above?  3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion?  4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement?  Submission Instructions   Interested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

This is all in support of the NIST mission: “To promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.” HPCVG owns and operates a CAVE (CAVE Automatic Visualization Environment) for its immersive visualization work at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD site.  A CAVE is a real-time hardware system that enables the user to see perspective-based true 3D images. For this to function correctly, the hardware system must be designed with real-time capability that enables viewing of real-time images. This Immersive Visualization Environment (IVE), along with the software that the Group develops, is on a critical path for all research in the Group. Its role is critical in HPCVG’s High Performance Computing work as it serves to speed code development and enable quick checking for errors as well as validation tests. It enables the visualization, measurement on visualizations, and analysis of results. This has led to solving critical outstanding problems in industry and contributing to the creation of standard reference materials and data. For example, it played a crucial role in the development of the standard reference materials for cement paste, mortar, and concrete. The CAVE has come to the end of its life as the display system can no longer be maintained. In order to ensure continuity of research efforts and to keep pace with the rapid advancement of technology in this area, it is important that the IVE be upgraded. NIST requires an upgrade to the IVE/CAVE on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus with newer display technology. Higher resolution and more complex data visualizations require a higher resolution and brighter display system with collaborative visualization capability. NIST has identified that a Direct View Light Emitting Diodes (LED) display system would offer a higher resolution and brighter display compared to its existing projection-based visualization system. Furthermore, a Direct View LED system would also be able to support dual view stereoscopic visualization where both users would have their own unique view angle of the visualization.  Thus, NIST a dual-view display system, as described in the attached Specifications.

This request does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. The intent of this request is to identify potential offerors for market research purposes only. ***** Request for Information (RFI) Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), which manages and operates portions of the Savannah River Site (SRS) under a Department of Energy (DOE) prime contract, solicits expressions of interest from potential suppliers with the experience, capability, and capacity to provide drum handling equipment. ­­­­ This RFI is issued to assist with finding potential suppliers interested in this solicitation. The SRS is located approximately 15 miles south of Aiken, South Carolina and is 310 contiguous square miles. Scope Summary Background The K-Area Complex (KAC) Drum handling warehouse (DHW) is proposed to be a 170’ x 100’ permanent structure with conventional steel framing or pre-engineered metal framing system and a clear span width. It will be constructed to support the receipt, inspection, testing, and storage of up to 3600, 7A type A, stainless steel drums. A robotic inspection area and High-Pressure Lab (HPL) will also be installed in the DHW. The Material Balance Area (MBA) is the portion of the building where the 3600 drums will be stored, and it is proposed to occupy approximately 76’ x 100’ of the structure. See Figure 1 below for a pre-conceptual layout of the warehouse. Note: this layout does not specify exact location or sizes of these rooms to allow flexibility for the design agency. Task First, we are requesting information for an Inventory Management System (IMS) to manage the drum inventory located within the MBA inside the DHW. This will include entrance to and exit from the MBA. The input of drums into this system will be post robotic inspection. The drums will exit inspection and pass through a barrier in a manner to prohibit unauthorized access to the MBA for rack storage (or equivalent) and retrieval.  Upon Retrieval, the drums will exit through a barrier, in a manner to prohibit unauthorized access, for disposition. Ideally, this system will be a more “off the shelf” automated systems to manage the drums.  We will consider engineered solutions for the end effector on lift trucks but desire an automated system that is developed and ready to use out of the box. Second, include options for an automated system to unload incoming palletized drums from trucks and place pallets in the “New CCO (Criticality Control Overpack) holding area” as seen in figure 1. Ideally this system can also disposition individual drums that exit the MBA and load those individual drums onto outbound truck. Third, include options that can automate the drum removal from a wrapped and banded pallet as seen in figure 2. This system should have the option to remove the drum from the pallet and place onto a conveyor to feed the robotic inspection station. Please note: Our hopes are for a vendor to supply a complete suite of solutions, but we realize all vendors may not be able to offer a product meeting all tasks; we will accept information on any and all tasks. Inventory Management System Requirements 1.   Store individual, non-palletized, 7A type A, 55-gallon stainless steel drums 2.   Total storage capacity of approximately 3,600 drums 3.   Drum weight is approximately 230 lb. each. 4.   Rate: incoming drums 5/hour, outgoing 20/hour 5.   7,000 drums to be annually processed through the warehouse. 6.   Handling system must preclude damage to drums and maintain structural quality. 7.   System must support bi-annual physical/visual “hands on inventory” of every drum. 8.   System shall support some form of manual backup if the automation process fails. 9.   Available footprint if 76 ft x 100 ft clear span with a maximum storage height of 25 ft (dictated by the sprinkler system). 10. Must support First in First Out handling. 11. Drums may be stored horizontally or vertically. Loading and unloading requirements Unloading inbound: 1.   Unload 42 pallets per truck that are double stacked. 2.   Unload One truck at a time and place in designated staging area 3.   Scan barcode capability Loading outbound: 1.   Loose individual drums 2.   40 drums per truck 3.   One truck at the time 4.   Scan barcode capability A supplier's response to the RFI does not guarantee they will be selected to participate in the RFP.

THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA's Langley Research Center offers a novel lifting and precision positioning device with hybrid functional characteristics of both crane-type lifting devices and robotic manipulators. The design of the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS) allows for fine positioning with complete control over both translation and rotation of the payload. In addition, the design permits several other operations using a wide variety of special purpose tools, such as a bucket, pallet forks, grappling devices, sensor and visualization packages, and dexterous robotic arms that can be quickly added to the tip. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees. NASA Langley developed the LSMS because of the need for a versatile system capable of performing multiple functions on the lunar surface, such as unloading components from a lander, transporting components to an operational site and installing them, and supporting service and replacement during component life. Current devices used for in-space operations are designed to work on orbit (zero g) only and thus do not have sufficient strength to operate on planetary surfaces. Traditional cranes are specialized to the task of lifting and are not capable of manipulator-type positioning operations. The innovations incorporated into the LSMS allow it to lower payloads to the ground over a significant portion of the workspace without use of a hoist, functioning like a robot manipulator, thus providing a rigid connection and very precise control of the payload. The LSMS uses a truss architecture with pure compression and tension members to achieve a lightweight design. The innovation of using multiple spreaders (like spokes in a wheel) allows the LSMS to maintain its high structural efficiency throughout its full range of motion. Rod portions of the tension members automatically lift off and re-engage the spreaders as the joint articulates, allowing a large range of motion while maintaining mechanical advantage. In addition, the LSMS uses a quick-change device at the tip end that enables automated acquisition of end effectors or special purpose tools to increase its versatility.

The associated NAICS code for this is 339112. The vendor will be Howmedica Osteonics Corp, 325 Corporate Drive, Mahwah, NJ 07430. REQUIREMENT: The MAKO Robotic Arm System (3 App) Total Knee/Partial Knee/Total Hip: 1 RIO Surgical Arm 1 RIO Guidance Module 1 RIO Camera Stand Assembly 1 RIO Accessory Kit 1 ROBOT Utilities 1.11.1 Software Disk 1 MAKO User Guide 5 Mako Power Trays 1 MAKOplasty CT Scan Kit MAKO Total Knee Application: 1 Mako Total Knee Software License 2 Mako Knee Trays 2 Pelvic Arrays 2 Stryker Leg Positioner Tray Kids 1 Surgeon and Surgical Staff Training, Total Knee Mako Partial Knee Application: 1 RESTORIS Partial Knewe Software License 2 Mako Knee Trays 2 IMP DeMayo Leg Positioner 25 Kits 1 Surgeon & Surgical Staff Training, Knee Mako Total Hip Application: 1 MAKOplasty Total Hip Software License 2 Mako Hip Instrument Kits 2 Mako THA Array Kits 2 Hip End Effector, Variable Angle 1 Surgeon & Surgical Staff Training, Hip There are several features/characteristics of the Mako system, as well as other reasons, which establish it as the only system to satisfy the Government s needs: 1. Mako is a semi-active system. The Mako robotic arm will guide the surgeon to precise bone cuts in total knee replacement. The surgeon utilizes a saw attached to a robotic arm. The robotic arm will have a defined area of resection based on the preoperative CT scan performed. This will minimize the potential for soft tissue injury such as neurovascular injury, ligamentous injury, or tendon injury. The robotic arm will not allow the surgeon to make cuts beyond the defined area of resection established by the preoperative CT scan. After a thorough surgical plan is created and approved by the surgeon, the Mako system assists surgeons with executing that plan using AccuStop haptic technology. The implant position, tracking and soft tissue balancing are assessed in a virtual 3D model by combining a preoperative CT and intraoperative bone registration. A CT scan uses a combination of 2D and digital geometry processing to generate a 3D image of the body. While plain film radiographs (X-rays) provide a 2D image of the scanned area, anatomic structures may overlap, creating an image which is less detailed than a CT scan. In a CT image, overlapping structures are eliminated, making the internal anatomy easier to visualize. In knee and hip arthroplasty procedures, the femoral version and tibial torsion 76 can provide critical guidance when planning a case. Bony anatomic landmarks of the femur and tibia can be clearly identified using 3D imaging technologies. After the surgeon assesses implant size and position in the preoperative plan, the robotic arm is introduced to the surgical site. The robotic arm uses AccuStop haptic technology to help ensure only the desired bone is resected. The robotic arm will give resistance, an audible warning and ultimately turn off if the surgeon attempts to move the cutting tool on the robotic arm outside the boundaries created in the preoperative plan. In addition, when the surgeon prepares the bone for the implant, the robotic arm guides the surgeon within the predefined area, allowing for a more accurate and better-aligned knee. The Mako system 1) provides the surgeon real-time sensory feedback, 2) places the surgeon in complete control, 3) helps ensure proper preparation of the bone 4) allows for precise placement of the implant, 5) produces minimal blood loss and a smaller scar, 6) helps preserve healthy bone and soft tissue, 7) results in less post-operative pain than manual techniques, and 8) provides a quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay. 2. The Mako robotic arm is FDA-approved for both cemented and non-cemented total knee replacement. The trend in current orthopedic surgery is toward the use of non-cemented components to allow bone ingrowth into the knee prosthesis and reduce the incidence of bone -cement interface failure with subsequent loosening and need for revision surgery. It is beneficial especially for the younger and more active patients. 3. The Mako system is utilized as a semi-active system for total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and total hip replacement. The system will guide the surgeon in performing bone cuts in total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and in acetabular reaming in total hip replacement. The major competitors of the Mako system do not provide robotic assistance in the performance of hip replacement. The Mako system provides direct surgeon assistance in the placement of the acetabular component by directing the surgeon through the use of a robotic arm in reaming of the acetabulum. The ideal placement of the acetabular cup is determined by the preoperative CT scan and allows for placement of the acetabular cup to reduce the potential for dislocation, optimize the leg length, and minimize the potential for impingement of the femur on the acetabulum. In addition, because the size of the acetabular cup can be determined from the preoperative CT scan, reaming of the acetabulum is minimized, Typically in a traditional hip replacement without the use of computer navigation, the acetabulum is enlarged progressively by 1-2mm increments until the ideal size is obtained, usually based on the size of the femoral head measured at the time of surgery, With the MAKO system, the size of the acetabular cup is determined preoperatively and a single reaming is performed with the predetermined acetabular size based on the pre operative CT scan. This can significantly reduce operative time. In addition, since the placement of the acetabular cup is directed by the robotic arm, the MAKO system allows for the precise placement of the acetabular cup determined by preoperative planning. This will reduce the incidence of cup malposition and associated complications including post op dislocation, premature polyethylene wear, leg length discrepancy, and impingement. 4. Stryker Mako robotic arm was requested for use at the Detroit VA to assist in joint replacement procedures - specifically total hip replacement and total knee replacement. Currently, the three orthopedic surgeons who perform hip and knee replacement surgery use Stryker instrumentation and implants to perform total joint replacement. The Mako robotic arm would be an extension of the instrumentation currently utilized to perform hip and knee replacement at the Detroit VA. Should a problem occur with the robot utilization, the procedure would need to be converted to the traditional type of open procedure which the facility currently performs, utilizing the various instrumentation available for intramedullary and/or extra medullary alignment, bone cuts, prosthetic trials, and prosthesis insertion. The Mako robot was designed to be used with Stryker components. Any of the surgeons utilizing the Mako robotic arm would easily be able to switch to a traditional approach currently used should the need arise. Each company that manufactures prosthetic components supplies their own instrumentation to allow for the appropriate placement of the final prosthesis. The instrumentation utilized for joint replacement can be extensive, and typically 5 or more trays of instruments and prosthetic trials are used during joint replacement. Utilizing a robot system other than the Mako system would not be compatible with the current system for which the three orthopedic surgeons performing joint replacement are currently familiar. To switch from the current system would require retraining of the current orthopedic surgeons performing joint replacement to become familiar with an entirely new system for alignment, bone cuts, and prosthesis insertion. This would be absolutely necessary since there is always a risk of robot failure and the need to convert the robotic-assisted procedure into a traditional instrument-guided procedure. There is a learning curve associated with switching to a new system and during that time procedures would take longer to perform, and patients may be subject to a higher rate of adverse event, which is not in the patient s best interest. Each system has its own nuances and experience using a system helps to provide a more fluid surgical procedure, reduce operative time, and minimize errors during the surgical procedure. In summary, the Mako robotic system will meet the clinical needs of the Detroit VA. It is the only system that will provide robotic assistance in the performance of both total hip and total knee replacement. There are other systems available that do not provide robotic assistance of total hip replacement. In addition, preoperative evaluation with use of CT scan in hip replacement has the potential to reduce operative times by limiting the amount of reaming to prepare the native acetabulum for placement of the prosthetic cup. The Mako robotic system is a product of Stryker. There are no other companies that produce this specific product. There are other companies that produce computer navigation or robotic arms for joint replacement, however, the Mako robotic system is FDA-approved for total knee replacement both cemented and non-cemented total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and total hip replacement.

This model, which is being developed by USGS in collaboration with Microsoft AI For Good using the PyTorch machine learning framework, is being trained using an existing database of images and human annotations of pairwise image rankings. The FPE project is currently hosted using Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions (CHS) platform. Services are required for two tasks as outlined in Attachment 1, Performance Work Statement, 1) assist in the development of an automated machine learning pipeline that will facilitate model training and inference on a station-by-station basis, and 2) to develop a real-time inference endpoint of a trained model specific to a single station that can be used to predict streamflow from new images transmitted to FPE through cellular or satellite connections. For both tasks, the contractor will focus solely on developing the necessary components within AWS SageMaker, namely a SageMaker Model Building Pipeline and a SageMaker Real-time Inference Endpoint (or possibly using alternative AWS computing service such as EC2 or Batch). The USGS will be responsible for developing the remaining project infrastructure to handle data ingest, storage, and access control, much of which already exists.

The purpose of this SS is to conduct Market Research to determine an acquisition strategy, to include determining if there are a sufficient number of Small Businesses capable of performing the requirements to warrant a set-aside, for the procurement of bronchoscopes at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (CLE VAMC), 10701 East Blvd., Cleveland, OH 44106. Mako SmartRobotics possesses several key features that differentiate it from other surgery platforms. After a thorough surgical plan is created and approved by the surgeon, the Mako System assists surgeons with executing that plan using AccuStop haptic technology. The implant position, tracking and soft tissue balancing are assessed in a virtual 3D model by combining a preoperative CT and intraoperative bone registration. A CT scan uses a combination of 2D and digital geometry processing to generate a 3D image of the body. While plain film radiographs (X-rays) provide a 2D image of the scanned area, anatomic structures may overlap, creating an image which is less detailed than a CT scan. In a CT image, overlapping structures are eliminated, making the internal anatomy easier to visualize. In knee and hip arthroplasty procedures, the femoral version and tibial torsion76 can provide critical guidance when planning a case. Bony anatomic landmarks of the femur and tibia can be clearly identified using 3D imaging technologies. After the surgeon assesses implant size and position in the preoperative plan, the robotic arm is introduced to the surgical site. The robotic arm uses AccuStop haptic technology to help ensure only the desired bone is resected. The robotic arm will give resistance, an audible warning and ultimately turn off if the surgeon attempts to move the cutting tool on the robotic arm outside the boundaries created in the preoperative plan.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) is soliciting information from contractors that can furnish a survey Using Innovative Data Tools to Understand, Predict, and Prepare for the Impacts of Climate Change on Veteran Health. Description of Work Required: Climate change increasingly affects every aspect of human life. Ongoing studies continue to report a close correlation between climate change and human health. It is estimated that global death rates will increase by 73 per 100,000 people by 2100 due to changes in temperature alone. Recent findings suggest that the health impacts of climate change are primarily related to underlying risk factors, such as chronic disease, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposure to other health stressors. Based on limited data, initial prediction scenarios suggest that many prevalent climate change impacts correlate with an increase in negative health outcomes. Beyond the direct effects on human health, it is also now established that as climate change affects the physical environment, the distribution and prevalence of certain infectious diseases will increase, resulting in increasing healthcare demand. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate change scientists, particularly with respect to Lyme disease and other vector-borne human diseases. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate change and disease, along with historical and experimental evidence, suggest that climate change can affect disease outbreaks and overall human health in nonlinear ways. The increasing negative effects from climate change could have extraordinary implications for the VA in terms of Veteran health, care delivery, health equity, emergency preparedness and response, and overall VA facility and health care costs. Recent trends in U.S. climate data demonstrate that extreme temperature events (both hot and cold) are becoming more frequent. Environmental factors have the potential to significantly impact healthcare delivery: a 2023 study found that large portions of the U.S. could experience electric grid strains coinciding with periods of extreme heat, leading to large surges in emergency department visits with the potential to overwhelm hospitals resources. Extreme temperatures will likely worsen chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and septicemia. This could especially harm the many Veterans that are predisposed to poor health outcomes to due to additional underlying risk factors such as chronic medical conditions, poverty, and homelessness. To fully understand the implications of these changes, more data integration and analysis is needed to correlate climate change and health effects and to project future climate impacts on VHA healthcare delivery. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, established a comprehensive government approach to the climate crisis, requiring each government agency to develop a Climate Action Plan (CAP). The 2021 VA CAP outlined five specific climate vulnerabilities, with two directly addressing the public health impacts of climate change, related to a) the increased demand for emergency care and supplies during dangerous natural disasters related to climate change, and b) the adverse human health impacts to Veterans (and VA employees) of climate-related environmental changes, such as heat waves, floods, droughts and other extreme events, leading to direct health effects as well as food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, changes in the quality and safety of air, food, water and stresses to mental health. Fortunately, new tools and resources are now available to provide innovative insights into these issues that will allow for better strategic approaches and strategy development. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have accelerated the adoption of algorithmically-enhanced data platforms and services and present an opportunity to gain high-fidelity insights into community-specific risk factors, including social and demographic data at varying geographic scales (national, state, region, neighborhood, and individual), such as wealth, education, physical environment, infrastructure, food, connection, safety, health care access, housing, and various other lifestyle and preference data for most adults across the U.S. These datasets include risk indicators for various disease states and conditions (such as homelessness), and sophisticated predictive algorithms that can be deployed across the data sets to model risk. New, high-resolution climate models are also available to allow for predictive capabilities at the community and individual levels that can be integrated with Veteran demographic data, creating a first-of-its-kind 360-degree assessment of climate impacts on Veteran populations. When combined with existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) veteran health data sources, these new analytical approaches could provide the most high-resolution insights ever achieved to understand the complex relationships between climate change and Veteran health. These insights can then be used to inform better healthcare delivery, pandemic preparedness, and allocation of healthcare resources as well as project non-linear growth in VA healthcare costs. These analytics could also shape alerting programs that could notify VHA public health experts before or during impending or developing public health concerns.

Jupiter s enterprise-grade, best-in-science solutions Climate Score Global, and the Climate Score Planning suite together form the world s only global-to-street resolution climate analytics offering. Their foundation, the Jupiter Climate Score Intelligence Platform, is based on rigorous global climate, weather, ocean, hydrological, and data science, and transparent methodologies. Use historical, longitudinal climate data and metrics derived from the integrated with Veteran medical record data to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot to determine the empirical relationship between climate change and three highly impactful chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma/emphysema, heart disease, and kidney disease) that are prevalent among Veterans. The pilot will be constructed using the risk profiles developed in Phase 1 and will incorporate anonymized individual medical record-level Veteran health data from the VHA medical record database. Utilizing the empirical relationships developed in Phase 2, use high-resolution climate forecasts based on modeling of three future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) to project climate impacts on the chronic health conditions evaluated in Phase 2. This approach can quantify physical climate risk anywhere in the world down to a 90-m resolution. It employs dozens of the scientific community s most respected climate models, coupled with machine learning, land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, severe weather, and more. The hazard output parameters include inland flooding, coastal flooding, heat, cold, wind, precipitation, drought, hail, and other severe weather, and wildfire. All climate hazards will incorporate similar components, which fall into two categories: those used to calculate future extreme hazards at a broad level, and those used to downscale those projections to the local level. Use the projections developed in Phase 3 to identify correlations between climate change and specific health conditions affecting Veterans to inform policies and interventions and model potential interventions that VHA could deploy to mitigate the risks identified, including outlining the additional resources that VHA will require to meet the needs of Veterans as demand for healthcare services grow with worsening environmental conditions. This four-pronged approach seeks to ensure the following: that VHA takes advantage of newly available climate and data technology resources to use longitudinal climate data below the zip code level to develop high-fidelity community risk profiles; that the pilots be conducted in >3 different locations (urban and rural) to ensure learning, cross-pollination, and evaluation of multiple potentially vulnerable Veteran populations; and that the test and evaluate approach facilitates an iterative transition to scale and ultimately impacts Veterans lives. VA s integration of an advanced analytics platform with existing VA and other supplemental data resources would allow for a real-time view of potential climate change-induced risk factors that may exacerbate or cause adverse health outcomes in Veterans. We plan to develop, integrate, and leverage an advanced analytics platform to inform development, implementation, evaluation, and scaling of a pilot program. To assess the most relevant and high-resolution climate intelligence, we will utilize advanced climate projections that can quantify the risk to populations due to changing environmental conditions across the entire U.S., including noncontiguous states and territories. For example, new ML and AI tools can determine how changes in the climate cause future flooding, extreme heat and cold, high winds, drought, and wildfires at 90-meter resolutions. The model products are determined by employing data from dozens of well-vetted climate models, coupled with land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, and severe weather to analyze trends in future climate scenarios. These outputs can quantify risk due to environmental perils in 5-year increments from 2020 through 2100, for three potential carbon emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). Over the past few years, organizations have leveraged data-driven insights from advanced analytics to make more informed and effective decisions. As technology has advanced, AI and ML techniques have been used to gain a more comprehensive and nuanced view of community behavior, allowing organizations to predict future trends, tailor healthcare strategies, and measure the effectiveness of their engagement efforts while optimizing resource allocation. Similarly, by pursuing the example activities and developing the outputs described above, the VHA PHNPO can not only better serve Veterans most vulnerable to the impacts of increasingly severe chronic health conditions in the near-term but can also realize the long-term benefits of yet-untapped AI and ML advances that can enhance understanding of community risks, develop predictive risk modeling, create tailored interventions, and measure engagement impacts. This will also help the PHNPO contribute to the broader community s understanding of how climate change changes environmental conditions and affects health risk factors for all Americans. 1.2.3 The Climate Action Plan also specifies that, in addition to preparing and deploying enhanced bio surveillance systems and epidemiologic investigations to better understand and address climate-related impacts, another key action required to prepare for the impact of climate change on Veteran health is readiness of critical supply and pharmaceutical stockpiles. The All-Hazards Emergency Cache (AHEC) comprised of Emergency Pharmacy Services (EPS), Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and PHNPO (Lead), provides short-term coverage for the initial 48-72 hours of a large-scale emergency and complements the contents of the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. Increases in temperatures and precipitation extremes are projected to result in extreme weather events, and climate change is also likely to change the epidemiology of certain infectious diseases. Resulting natural disasters, large-scale emergencies, and pandemics will stress local supplies on hand and potentially interrupt supply chain activities. VA relies on these stockpiles to respond to the impact of surges in the demand for supplies and to mitigate impacts of high consequence infections. VA is also prepared to participate in regional disaster planning and response, as part of VA s Fourth Mission activities under the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. Ch. 68). PHNPO must be prepared to adapt and update AHEC, as needed, to respond to the effects of climate change on disease transmission, and to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the AHEC program itself. 1.3 Period of Performance: Date of award to one (1) year. 1.4 Place of Performance: TBD 1.5 Hours of Operation: TBD 1.6 Type of Contract: TBD 1.7 Invoicing: All invoices from the contractor shall be submitted electronically in accordance with VAAR Clause 852.232-72 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) is soliciting information from contractors that can furnish a survey Using Innovative Data Tools to Understand, Predict, and Prepare for the Impacts of Climate Change on Veteran Health. Description of Work Required: Climate change increasingly affects every aspect of human life. Ongoing studies continue to report a close correlation between climate change and human health. It is estimated that global death rates will increase by 73 per 100,000 people by 2100 due to changes in temperature alone. Recent findings suggest that the health impacts of climate change are primarily related to underlying risk factors, such as chronic disease, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposure to other health stressors. Based on limited data, initial prediction scenarios suggest that many prevalent climate change impacts correlate with an increase in negative health outcomes. Beyond the direct effects on human health, it is also now established that as climate change affects the physical environment, the distribution and prevalence of certain infectious diseases will increase, resulting in increasing healthcare demand. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate change scientists, particularly with respect to Lyme disease and other vector-borne human diseases. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate change and disease, along with historical and experimental evidence, suggest that climate change can affect disease outbreaks and overall human health in nonlinear ways. The increasing negative effects from climate change could have extraordinary implications for the VA in terms of Veteran health, care delivery, health equity, emergency preparedness and response, and overall VA facility and health care costs. Recent trends in U.S. climate data demonstrate that extreme temperature events (both hot and cold) are becoming more frequent. Environmental factors have the potential to significantly impact healthcare delivery: a 2023 study found that large portions of the U.S. could experience electric grid strains coinciding with periods of extreme heat, leading to large surges in emergency department visits with the potential to overwhelm hospitals resources. Extreme temperatures will likely worsen chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and septicemia. This could especially harm the many Veterans that are predisposed to poor health outcomes to due to additional underlying risk factors such as chronic medical conditions, poverty, and homelessness. To fully understand the implications of these changes, more data integration and analysis is needed to correlate climate change and health effects and to project future climate impacts on VHA healthcare delivery. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, established a comprehensive government approach to the climate crisis, requiring each government agency to develop a Climate Action Plan (CAP). The 2021 VA CAP outlined five specific climate vulnerabilities, with two directly addressing the public health impacts of climate change, related to a) the increased demand for emergency care and supplies during dangerous natural disasters related to climate change, and b) the adverse human health impacts to Veterans (and VA employees) of climate-related environmental changes, such as heat waves, floods, droughts and other extreme events, leading to direct health effects as well as food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, changes in the quality and safety of air, food, water and stresses to mental health. Fortunately, new tools and resources are now available to provide innovative insights into these issues that will allow for better strategic approaches and strategy development. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have accelerated the adoption of algorithmically-enhanced data platforms and services and present an opportunity to gain high-fidelity insights into community-specific risk factors, including social and demographic data at varying geographic scales (national, state, region, neighborhood, and individual), such as wealth, education, physical environment, infrastructure, food, connection, safety, health care access, housing, and various other lifestyle and preference data for most adults across the U.S. These datasets include risk indicators for various disease states and conditions (such as homelessness), and sophisticated predictive algorithms that can be deployed across the data sets to model risk. New, high-resolution climate models are also available to allow for predictive capabilities at the community and individual levels that can be integrated with Veteran demographic data, creating a first-of-its-kind 360-degree assessment of climate impacts on Veteran populations. When combined with existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) veteran health data sources, these new analytical approaches could provide the most high-resolution insights ever achieved to understand the complex relationships between climate change and Veteran health. These insights can then be used to inform better healthcare delivery, pandemic preparedness, and allocation of healthcare resources as well as project non-linear growth in VA healthcare costs. These analytics could also shape alerting programs that could notify VHA public health experts before or during impending or developing public health concerns.

Based on limited data, initial prediction scenarios suggest that many prevalent climate change impacts correlate with an increase in negative health outcomes. Beyond the direct effects on human health, it is also now established that as climate change affects the physical environment, the distribution and prevalence of certain infectious diseases will increase, resulting in increasing healthcare demand. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate change scientists, particularly with respect to Lyme disease and other vector-borne human diseases. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate change and disease, along with historical and experimental evidence, suggest that climate change can affect disease outbreaks and overall human health in nonlinear ways. The increasing negative effects from climate change could have extraordinary implications for the VA in terms of Veteran health, care delivery, health equity, emergency preparedness and response, and overall VA facility and health care costs. Recent trends in U.S. climate data demonstrate that extreme temperature events (both hot and cold) are becoming more frequent. Environmental factors have the potential to significantly impact healthcare delivery: a 2023 study found that large portions of the U.S. could experience electric grid strains coinciding with periods of extreme heat, leading to large surges in emergency department visits with the potential to overwhelm hospitals resources. Extreme temperatures will likely worsen chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and septicemia. This could especially harm the many Veterans that are predisposed to poor health outcomes to due to additional underlying risk factors such as chronic medical conditions, poverty, and homelessness. To fully understand the implications of these changes, more data integration and analysis is needed to correlate climate change and health effects and to project future climate impacts on VHA healthcare delivery. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, established a comprehensive government approach to the climate crisis, requiring each government agency to develop a Climate Action Plan (CAP). The 2021 VA CAP outlined five specific climate vulnerabilities, with two directly addressing the public health impacts of climate change, related to a) the increased demand for emergency care and supplies during dangerous natural disasters related to climate change, and b) the adverse human health impacts to Veterans (and VA employees) of climate-related environmental changes, such as heat waves, floods, droughts and other extreme events, leading to direct health effects as well as food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, changes in the quality and safety of air, food, water and stresses to mental health. Fortunately, new tools and resources are now available to provide innovative insights into these issues that will allow for better strategic approaches and strategy development. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have accelerated the adoption of algorithmically-enhanced data platforms and services and present an opportunity to gain high-fidelity insights into community-specific risk factors, including social and demographic data at varying geographic scales (national, state, region, neighborhood, and individual), such as wealth, education, physical environment, infrastructure, food, connection, safety, health care access, housing, and various other lifestyle and preference data for most adults across the U.S. These datasets include risk indicators for various disease states and conditions (such as homelessness), and sophisticated predictive algorithms that can be deployed across the data sets to model risk. New, high-resolution climate models are also available to allow for predictive capabilities at the community and individual levels that can be integrated with Veteran demographic data, creating a first-of-its-kind 360-degree assessment of climate impacts on Veteran populations. When combined with existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) veteran health data sources, these new analytical approaches could provide the most high-resolution insights ever achieved to understand the complex relationships between climate change and Veteran health. These insights can then be used to inform better healthcare delivery, pandemic preparedness, and allocation of healthcare resources as well as project non-linear growth in VA healthcare costs. These analytics could also shape alerting programs that could notify VHA public health experts before or during impending or developing public health concerns. PURPOSE: 1.2.2 VHA PHNPO s intent is to leverage the resources described above to innovate an integrated public health surveillance platform and analytics tool combining Veteran medical record data, evidence-based climate data and forecasting, and Veteran demographic data, and conduct a pilot effort to evaluate climate and Veteran health forecast scenarios as follows: Employ the novel data and algorithmic platform, JUPITER, to build on the recent work, Analysis of Correlation between Climate Change and Human Health Based on a Machine Learning Approach to develop high-fidelity community-level climate and health risk profiles for three U.S. counties (at least one rural and one urban/large metropolitan city) using existing VA datasets. Jupiter Intelligence is the global market, science, and technology leader in physical climate analytics for resiliency planning, risk management, and disclosure. Jupiter s customers include five percent of the world s largest enterprises, many companies within the Global 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense, and public sector authorities in jurisdictions around the world. Its analytics have been adopted by at least one of the world s five largest entities in asset management, banking, chemicals, insurance, oil and gas, minerals and mining, electric utilities, and construction. Disclosed private sector customers include AstraZeneca, BP, Entergy, Hawaiian Electric, JLL, Liberty Mutual, MS&AD, Nephila and Zurich Insurance. In addition to the DoD, Jupiter s public-sector work includes FEMA, NASA, NOAA, New York City, the City of Miami, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Broward County (Florida), and national security agencies. Jupiter s partnerships include most of the world s largest accounting, consulting, engineering and insurance firms, and defense contractors, including Aon, Bain, Boston Consulting Group, Guide house (formerly Navigant), MS&AD, and Zurich Insurance. The Jupiter Promise program partners with NGOs to provide climate analytics to improve resilience for the world s most vulnerable, under-resourced populations. Jupiter s enterprise-grade, best-in-science solutions Climate Score Global, and the Climate Score Planning suite together form the world s only global-to-street resolution climate analytics offering. Their foundation, the Jupiter Climate Score Intelligence Platform, is based on rigorous global climate, weather, ocean, hydrological, and data science, and transparent methodologies. Use historical, longitudinal climate data and metrics derived from the integrated with Veteran medical record data to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot to determine the empirical relationship between climate change and three highly impactful chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma/emphysema, heart disease, and kidney disease) that are prevalent among Veterans. The pilot will be constructed using the risk profiles developed in Phase 1 and will incorporate anonymized individual medical record-level Veteran health data from the VHA medical record database. Utilizing the empirical relationships developed in Phase 2, use high-resolution climate forecasts based on modeling of three future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) to project climate impacts on the chronic health conditions evaluated in Phase 2. This approach can quantify physical climate risk anywhere in the world down to a 90-m resolution. It employs dozens of the scientific community s most respected climate models, coupled with machine learning, land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, severe weather, and more. The hazard output parameters include inland flooding, coastal flooding, heat, cold, wind, precipitation, drought, hail, and other severe weather, and wildfire. All climate hazards will incorporate similar components, which fall into two categories: those used to calculate future extreme hazards at a broad level, and those used to downscale those projections to the local level. Use the projections developed in Phase 3 to identify correlations between climate change and specific health conditions affecting Veterans to inform policies and interventions and model potential interventions that VHA could deploy to mitigate the risks identified, including outlining the additional resources that VHA will require to meet the needs of Veterans as demand for healthcare services grow with worsening environmental conditions. This four-pronged approach seeks to ensure the following: that VHA takes advantage of newly available climate and data technology resources to use longitudinal climate data below the zip code level to develop high-fidelity community risk profiles; that the pilots be conducted in >3 different locations (urban and rural) to ensure learning, cross-pollination, and evaluation of multiple potentially vulnerable Veteran populations; and that the test and evaluate approach facilitates an iterative transition to scale and ultimately impacts Veterans lives. VA s integration of an advanced analytics platform with existing VA and other supplemental data resources would allow for a real-time view of potential climate change-induced risk factors that may exacerbate or cause adverse health outcomes in Veterans. We plan to develop, integrate, and leverage an advanced analytics platform to inform development, implementation, evaluation, and scaling of a pilot program. To assess the most relevant and high-resolution climate intelligence, we will utilize advanced climate projections that can quantify the risk to populations due to changing environmental conditions across the entire U.S., including noncontiguous states and territories. For example, new ML and AI tools can determine how changes in the climate cause future flooding, extreme heat and cold, high winds, drought, and wildfires at 90-meter resolutions. The model products are determined by employing data from dozens of well-vetted climate models, coupled with land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, and severe weather to analyze trends in future climate scenarios. These outputs can quantify risk due to environmental perils in 5-year increments from 2020 through 2100, for three potential carbon emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). Over the past few years, organizations have leveraged data-driven insights from advanced analytics to make more informed and effective decisions. As technology has advanced, AI and ML techniques have been used to gain a more comprehensive and nuanced view of community behavior, allowing organizations to predict future trends, tailor healthcare strategies, and measure the effectiveness of their engagement efforts while optimizing resource allocation. Similarly, by pursuing the example activities and developing the outputs described above, the VHA PHNPO can not only better serve Veterans most vulnerable to the impacts of increasingly severe chronic health conditions in the near-term but can also realize the long-term benefits of yet-untapped AI and ML advances that can enhance understanding of community risks, develop predictive risk modeling, create tailored interventions, and measure engagement impacts. This will also help the PHNPO contribute to the broader community s understanding of how climate change changes environmental conditions and affects health risk factors for all Americans. 1.2.3 The Climate Action Plan also specifies that, in addition to preparing and deploying enhanced bio surveillance systems and epidemiologic investigations to better understand and address climate-related impacts, another key action required to prepare for the impact of climate change on Veteran health is readiness of critical supply and pharmaceutical stockpiles. The All-Hazards Emergency Cache (AHEC) comprised of Emergency Pharmacy Services (EPS), Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and PHNPO (Lead), provides short-term coverage for the initial 48-72 hours of a large-scale emergency and complements the contents of the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. Increases in temperatures and precipitation extremes are projected to result in extreme weather events, and climate change is also likely to change the epidemiology of certain infectious diseases. Resulting natural disasters, large-scale emergencies, and pandemics will stress local supplies on hand and potentially interrupt supply chain activities. VA relies on these stockpiles to respond to the impact of surges in the demand for supplies and to mitigate impacts of high consequence infections. VA is also prepared to participate in regional disaster planning and response, as part of VA s Fourth Mission activities under the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. Ch. 68). PHNPO must be prepared to adapt and update AHEC, as needed, to respond to the effects of climate change on disease transmission, and to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the AHEC program itself. 1.3 Period of Performance: Date of award to one (1) year. 1.4 Place of Performance: TBD 1.5 Hours of Operation: TBD 1.6 Type of Contract: TBD 1.7 Invoicing: All invoices from the contractor shall be submitted electronically in accordance with VAAR Clause 852.232-72 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) Office of Procurement, Acquisition, and Logistics (OPAL) Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) on behalf of VHA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with the FAR 10.002(b)(2) to determine the availability and technical capabilities of qualified sources. The period of performance will consist of a base of 12 months with four 12-month option periods from the date of award. The SAC in conjunction with VHA is seeking a qualified source to manufacture Washers Lab/Surgical Instrument Ultrasonic on an agency-wide basis. VA intends to award a Brand Name or Equal (BNOE) single award Requirements contract for this requirement IAW with FAR 16.503. Vendors will be required to deliver Washers Lab/Surgical Instrument Ultrasonic to VA medical centers and facilities throughout the United States. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339113 Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, Product Service Code: 6515 Medical and Surgical Instruments, Equipment, and Supplies, and the associated size standard is 750 employees. The FAR Provision found at 52.204-7(b)(1) requires that All interested Offerors must be registered in SAM prior to submitting an offer or quotation. You may access the SAM website at SAM.gov | Home. All offerors must be certified as with the appropriate NAICS code on the SAM website. All SDVOSB/VOSB offerors must be verified in the SBA database at https://veterans.certify.sba.gov/#search at the time of offer submission. This notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive contract. It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes. 2.0 SCOPE Washers Lab/Surgical Instrument Ultrasonic are designed for automatic removal of dirt, stains, and/or biological debris (i.e., washing) from labware (e.g., glass and plastic beakers, test tubes), surgical instruments, and/or other critical devices using ultrasonic energy. The process is performed by delivering ultrasonic waves to a tank filled with a warm cleaning solution (e.g., detergents formulated for ultrasonic cleansing). These systems typically include a radiofrequency generator (frequencies from 25 to 40 kHz are typical), ultrasonic transducers, a heating unit, and a stainless-steel tank with baskets and/or trays. Cleaning is performed by the scrubbing action of the ultrasonic vibration and also by the implosion of bubbles (i.e., cavitation effect). Surgical instrument ultrasonic washers may include two or three tanks to perform automatic cycles for washing, rinsing, and drying; they may also include heating capabilities. This equipment may provide some level of disinfection by killing and/or inactivating several microorganism species; it is commonly used after general cleaning and before thermal or chemical disinfection. This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal which requires the offeror to indicate that each product being offered is an equal product to the STERISÂ® Washers Lab/Surgical Instrument Ultrasonic.

45811,R499--RFI - Veterans Affairs Processing and Automation Services (VPAS),36C10D24Q0038,"VETERANS AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF",,,2024-02-09,,null ,https://sam.gov/opp/314bc6bee02643949558dd24d23eeb6b/view,"REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RFI 36C10D24Q0038 1.0 INTRODUCTION THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for the Veterans Affairs Processing and Automation Services (VPAS). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only. There is no obligation for the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 15.201(E), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by VBA in developing its acquisition strategy and informing, refining, and finalizing the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response. Only electronic responses to this RFI will be accepted. The Government will not pay for any time expended or information submitted in response to this RFI. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this RFI. 2.0 BACKGROUND Through its three (3) administrations, National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Affairs (VA) administers vital services to America's Veterans. VA provides health care services, benefits programs, and access to national cemeteries for former military personnel and their dependents. The fundamental mission of VBA is to provide Veterans, transitioning service members, and their families with benefits and services including education benefits, home loans, life insurance, and disability compensation or pension benefits. Award of these benefits often requires information gathering from a multitude of third parties, government agencies and digital repositories as well as the application of complex rules. Prior to 2012, VBA processed most benefits utilizing paper claim folders. In September 2012 VBA began scanning claim folders and uploading the files into the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) for claims processors to view electronically as searchable Portable Document Files (PDFs). Scanning efforts expanded to mail in 2014 and scanning of historical file banks in 2016. The success of VBA s scanning program supported the reduction of rating claim backlogs from over 600,000 in early 2012 to less than 90,000 by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Although the COVID-19 period limited the pace of reducing the backlog, progress continued until COVID limitations were lifted and the pace of claims increased such that the current inventory is more than 300,000. The scanning program also enabled the opportunity to further reduce the claim cycle by extracting data from images to automate business processes. The VBA continues to need contractor support for reducing the inventory. In today s process, mail arrives at the Evidence Intake Center from Veterans, or their representatives, to support a Veteran s, or their family member s, claim for benefits and services. This mail is tracked and converted into searchable PDF (PDF Image plus Text) format in compliance with the VBMS PDF specification. Also, as records are located or generated during claim development activities, they are retrieved and added to the body of evidence supporting the claim in the systems of records for the claimant. These materials typically support one or more business processes, primarily related to Veterans benefits claims processing, using other input material provided by other entities (such as VHA, NCA and other federal partners). The Veterans Intake, Conversion and Communication Services (VICCS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) was established in 2019 to continuously improve benefits processing efficiency and cycle-time. VBA has partnered with industry leaders to provide a host of managed-service contracts but the period of performance for the VICCS expires in September 2024, the VA will need a replacement IDIQ. This VA Processing and Automation Services (VPAS) IDIQ provides a successor replacement to the VICCS IDIQ to provide managed services for all elements of VA to provide the following categories of services: Source Material Processing Services, such as Intake Source Material Tracking Source Material Management Digitization and data extraction Upload and Routing Inbound Mail Management Support Rule-Based Processing (such Optical Character Recognition, Iterative Fusion based Recognizer, Natural Language Processing) Centralized Outbound Data Transfer Graphical Self-Service Report Generation Inbound Calls Outbound Calls Automation Development and Operations Business Process Automation Claims / Application processing Private medical records processing Mail automation Veteran transition support Records Research Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) / Privacy Act request processing Operations and Maintenance Integration Services, such as Organizational Integration Connectivity, Access, and Security Data Integration Automation Integration Integration Library Data Storage, Sharing and Analysis Services Customer/Employee Experience Services Enabling and Support Services, such as Business Processing Professional services Organizational Change Management Marketing/Outreach Communications Strategy, Planning, and Implementation Customer Relationship Services Case Management Services System Modernization and Retirement Services Training Services Integration, Setup, Test and Validation Services Service Updates Transition In/Out Help Desk / Call Center Services Requirements may fall within one specific service area but in many cases, the requirements will encompass and apply across and within multiple service areas. VBA anticipates continuing, enhancing and expanding the above referenced services through contractor support by means of ultimately competing this work among highly qualified and capable contractors. However, this RFI does not represent a solicitation nor is it a guarantee of a future solicitation. The VA/VBA plans to hold a virtual RFI Industry Day in support of this RFI and will provide an overview presentation. The Virtual Industry Day will be held on February 21, 2024, between 2:00 pm 3:00 pm eastern time.

As prescribed in 819.7011, insert the following clause: VA Notice Of Total set-Aside For Verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (NOV 2022) (a)Â Definition.Â for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVOSB : (1) Means a small business concern - (i) Not less than 51 percent of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more service-disabled Veterans or eligible surviving spouses (see VAAR802.101, Surviving Spouse definition); (ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled Veterans (or eligible surviving spouses) or, in the case of a service-disabled Veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such Veteran; (iii) The business meets Federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code identified in the solicitation document; (iv) The business has been verified for ownership and control pursuant to 38 CFR part 74 and is listed in VA's Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database atÂ https://www.vetbiz.va.gov/vip/;Â and (v) The business will comply with VAAR subpartÂ 819.70Â and Small Business Administration (SBA) regulations regarding small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR parts 121 and 125, provided that any reference therein to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB, unless otherwise stated in this clause. (2) The term Service-disabled Veteran means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). (3) The term small business concern has the meaning given that term under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). (4) The term small business concern owned and controlled by Veterans with service-connected disabilities has the meaning given the term small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans Â under section 3(q)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q)(2)), except that for a VA contract the firm must be listed in the VIP database (see paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this clause). (b)Â General. (1) Offers are solicited only from VIP-listed SDVOSBs. Offers received from entities that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs at the time of offer shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed SDVOSB who is eligible at the time of submission of offer(s) and at the time of award. (3) The requirements in this clause apply to any contract, order or subcontract where the firm receives a benefit or preference from its designation as an SDVOSB, including set-asides, sole source awards, and evaluation preferences. (c)Â Representation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible to receive award of a resulting contract. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpartÂ 819.70. (d)Â Agreement.Â When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpartÂ 819.70Â and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. Unless otherwise stated in this clause, a requirement in 13 CFR parts 121 and 125 that applies to an SDVO SBC, is to be construed to also apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e.,Â a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows: (1)Â Services.Â In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract (2)Â Supplies/products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract. (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CRF 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements. (3)Â General construction.Â In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (4)Â Special trade construction contractors.Â In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5)Â Subcontracting.Â An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e)Â Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period.Â An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: [Contracting Officer check as appropriate.] __By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or __By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f)Â Joint ventures.Â A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g)Â Precedence.Â The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpartÂ 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h)Â Misrepresentation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

(3) The requirements in this clause apply to any contract, order, or subcontract where the firm receives a benefit or preference from its designation as an SDVOSB, including set-asides, sole source awards, and evaluation preferences. (c)Â Representation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible to receive award of a resulting contract. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpartÂ 819.70. (d)Â Agreement.Â When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpartÂ 819.70Â and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. Unless otherwise stated in this clause, a requirement in 13 CFR parts 121 and 125 that applies to an SDVO SBC, is to be construed to also apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e.,Â a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows: (1)Â Services.Â In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract (2)Â Supplies/products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract. (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CRF 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements. (3)Â General construction.Â In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (4)Â Special trade construction contractors.Â In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5)Â Subcontracting.Â An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e)Â Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period.Â An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: [Contracting Officer check as appropriate.] __By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or __By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f)Â Joint ventures.Â A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g)Â Precedence.Â The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpartÂ 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h)Â Misrepresentation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

53446,TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITY Intelligent Lifecycle Management for Battery Energy Storage: Transitioning from First Life to Second Life and Materials Recycling,BA-1417,"ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF",,,2023-10-31,,,https://sam.gov/opp/1b6a1f13500d4d549598e4ba9de236d8/view,"TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITY Intelligent Lifecycle Management for Battery Energy Storage: Transitioning from First Life to Second Life and Materials Recycling An advanced technical approach to extend battery lifecycle and facilitate second-life uses and materials recycling. Opportunity:   Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), offers the opportunity to explore a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this approach for extending battery life. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses, and, ultimately, an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:        The broad incorporation of battery energy storage (BES) into numerous applications necessitates a comprehensive, cradle-to-grave management strategy. As batteries exhaust their first-life usage, a physics-based rationale is needed to transition these assets into secondary applications or materials recycling. This approach is essential to maintain the value and economic benefit of BES beyond their initial deployment.  Description:    The focus of this initiative from INL is a systematic coupling of diagnostic data markers from aged battery cells with physics-based model (PBM) interpretations. The diagnostic data and predictive PBM are integrated into an algorithmic platform that analyzes large matrices for second-use scenarios. This platform addresses the aging path dependency of batteries over their first and secondary life applications. It is developed on the solid foundation of the INL CellSage suite of PBM tools, which is known for its reliable prediction of battery aging during primary-to-secondary life transition. Benefits:           •    Provides actionable, data for transitioning batteries from first-life to second-life uses. •    Enables a strategic approach assessing battery end of life for materials recycling. •    Rapid and accurate connection of battery use conditions to remaining useful life for specific applications. •    Reduction in test time for PBM learning, using less data compared to machine learning methods. •    Accelerated decision-making process for optimal battery deployment. Applications:     •    Optimal deployment in electric-drive vehicles (land, water, air). •    Expansion of stationary storage capacity. •    Enhancement of consumer electronics lifespan. •    Efficient evaluation and sorting of used batteries in regional facilities supporting the second-use market. Development Status: TRL 4: Technology has been validated in a laboratory environment.     IP Status:        Provisional Patent Application No. 63/509,201, “Battery Energy Storage (BES) Asset Management to Facilitate Transition from Battery First Life to Second Life Using Physics-Based Modeling,” BEA Docket No. BA-1417.     INL seeks to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market.

54096,TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: High Accurate Position Detection and Shape Sensing with Fiber Optics (LAR-TOPS-79),T2P-LaRC-00128,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION,,,2023-10-12,,,https://sam.gov/opp/123dbd5a5ec547a0b942c3fe9004dfbf/view,"NASA’s Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA's Langley Research Center has demonstrated a patent pending method and apparatus for determining the position, in three dimensions, of any point on an optical fiber. The new method uses low reflectance Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensors in a multi-core fiber to determine how any point along that fiber is positioned in space. The characteristics of optical fibers and the FBGs vary with curvature, and by sensing the relative change of FBGs in each of three or more fiber cores, the three-dimensional change in position can be determined. By using this method in monitoring applications where optical fibers can be deployed--such as in structures, medical devices, or robotics--precise deflection, end position, and location can be determined in near real time. This innovative position detection method offers 10 times greater positional accuracy than comparable optical techniques. NASA's novel method was developed to more accurately measure the position and shape of optical fibers. Multi-core optical fibers contain multiple light-guiding cores arranged symmetrically. Sensors, such as FBGs, are embedded into each of the cores. Such an arrangement allows for the measurement of strain in each core of the fiber at specific axial locations along the fiber. When a multi-core fiber is subjected to bending, the strain imposed in each core relative to one another is used to provide position information. In the past, shape-sensing measurements using optical fibers estimated bending at sequential points along the fiber, and the resulting measurement had many discontinuities and errors. The combination of these errors resulted in a very poor indication of actual fiber position in three-dimensional space. NASA's patent-pending algorithms and apparatus incorporate not only fiber bending measurements, but fiber twisting measurements as well, to eliminate previous sources of error. The uniqueness of the algorithm is in how the curvature, bend-direction, and twisting information of the fiber are all brought together to obtain a highly accurate 3-D location and shape characterization. The new methods have been demonstrated to significantly improve the accuracy of multi-core fiber optic shape sensors.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has developed multiple ways for amorphous robots to autonomously move across a surface without needing conventional wheels or legs. Amorphous robots are useful in dusty and sandy environments in which greater mobility, passive shape changing, and immunity to dust and contamination are important. This includes both surface and subsurface robotic exploration. Amorphous robots are also useful in emergency and industrial activities, such as search and rescue (e.g., exploring rubble following an earthquake) and inspection of oil pipelines or sewage systems. Multiple locomotion techniques are proposed: Bladder Bot. This design involves a multi-stage process that makes use of a fluid-filled bladder with circulating high-viscosity fluid. Movement of the robot is not based on external moving parts, but rather is caused due to the propulsion of the contained fluid by an internal valve system. The Bladder Bot can be designed as an amoeba or with rotating fluid compartments. Inchworm Robot. This robot has a tube-like design. Locomotion occurs when internal ferro fluid moves through an electromagnetic ring. The motion resembles the way an inchworm moves. Electromagnetic Sphere Robot. This design consists of multiple electromagnetic spheres inside a fluid-filled flexible bladder. Motion is initiated when the polarity of the electromagnets are altered sequentially to move the magnetic balls internally, which thus causes the robotic locomotion. Polymer Cell Robot. The polymer cell robot design consists of multiple polymeric cells encapsulated in a larger flexible outer shell. The cells individually either swell or contract, causing the center of gravity to change, and thus the object rolls accordingly.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Operations Contract II (NOC II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to, support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA NOC, contract #80JSC017C0001. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). Under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,000. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all categories of Large Business, Small Business (SB), all socioeconomic categories of Small Business and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (ED-WOSB) or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses received. NOC II Description: The proposed NOC II contract will provide operational support services to the NBL. It is anticipated that the NOC II will be a single-award, Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion Form contract with an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity feature. The current NOC IDIQ feature represents approximately 30% of contract value, and it is anticipated that NOC II will maintain a similar percentage of IDIQ contract value. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and/or Firm-Fixed-Price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the current NOC Statement of Work (SOW) and Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) are attached to this posting. NASA anticipates releasing the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs within several weeks. It is anticipated that there will be some changes between the NOC SOW and DRDs and the NOC II SOW and DRDs. Interested parties are encouraged to carefully review the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs for changes upon their release.   The NBL is a key Agency asset that supports human space flight training by simulating weightless and partial gravity environments through underwater diving operations. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time mission troubleshooting, flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support of external customers. Because of the NBL’s importance to the NASA mission, and the highly hazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to agency management and the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics and Mockup Facility (LMF) that provides fabrication, repair, and maintenance of mockups. The NBL is operated by JSC’s Flight Operations Directorate (FOD). The NBL currently supports the International Space Station (ISS), Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, and Lunar Surface operations), other NASA space programs, and other JSC directorates (e.g. Engineering, Health and Human Performance, and Public Affairs). In addition to the JSC directorates, the NBL also supports other NASA field centers, other Government agencies (e.g. U.S. Coast Guard), and commercial companies. The support provided includes the use of the NBL for submerged and surface activities. The LMF is also available to provide hardware repairs or modifications to increase productivity in the NBL. The mockups used in the NBL are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft, spacecraft components, or lunar surface features. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from “low fidelity”, which models the basic volume and shape of the item, to “high fidelity” which very closely matches the “look and feel” of the item. Mockups can be built to last briefly (e.g. for short-term engineering evaluations) or for many years. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics and are intended for multi-year use. JSC is eager to support and partner with the burgeoning Commercial Spaceflight Industry and recognizes that the NBL provides unique capabilities that may be helpful to many entities. NASA anticipates incentivizing the successful support of external customers but anticipates little to no active recruitment of new customers due to the expected high utilization of the NBL during the period of performance of NOC II. However, NASA wants to ensure that new customers can be recruited if utilization falls below expected levels. Note that NASA anticipates significant changes to the External Customer metrics and incentives under the NOC II requirement from those in the attached NOC SOW and DRDs. The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: Raytheon Company Contract Number: 80JSC017C0001 Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $160M Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2024 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: 1. Technical - Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the current NOC SOW. Please identify specific SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. If subcontracting or if a joint venture is anticipated, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture partners and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. 2. Small Business – If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the current NOC SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. 3. General –        a. What additional documents would you like to see on the NOC II contract website or included in the Technical Library?        b. What barriers or obstacles do you foresee to potentially bidding on this contract? Can you identify any Government                  acquisition approaches that would increase the competitiveness of this procurement?        c. Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon,               what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages?        d. Due to NBL limited excess capacity, NASA anticipates little to no active recruitment of new external customers. What flexible incentive mechanisms would you suggest that would enable NASA to incentivize future recruitment of external customers if unanticipated excess capacity became available?       e. NBL divers and other operations personnel bring tremendous value to human spaceflight through their training and experience. With increasing opportunities in commercial space and other related fields, recruitment and retention of these highly skilled operators is crucial. How can the contract be structured to best enable this? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies?       f. What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure?       g. Provide feedback and rationale on any other topics, factors, and/or items of interest you would like to address regarding this potential procurement. 4. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: a. Name and address of the firm’s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) b. Size of business i. Average annual revenue for past three years ii. Number of employees iii.

If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The JSC Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the NOC II acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the NOC II may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for NOC II. Specifically, NASA anticipates the effort under NOC II will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Provide assessments of the safety or readiness of commercial suit vendors to integrate and perform testing in the NBL Potential access to data from other commercial companies or government agencies acquired through integrating and assessing the safety of hardware put into the NBL for testing, training, or evaluation Potential access to assessment data for hardware tested, trained, or evaluated in the NBL Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated NOC II contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the NOC II contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract Potential impaired objectivity if the NOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g. affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA’s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf    Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the NOC II contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed NOC II contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the NOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential NOC II Request for Proposal (RFP)? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. Companies are cautioned to consider OCI when responding to this RFI, and to consider internal mitigation measures that would prevent OCI from adversely affecting a company’s future procurement prospects. NASA is not in a position to respond to Offerors on the existence of OCI or remedial measures. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Offerors will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its OCI submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP.   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.   Additionally, in support of EO 13985, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of ""equity."" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. NASA seeks input in the following areas: To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g. outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it.

This is because the text discusses the potential OCI issues that may arise from the proposed contract, including unequal access to nonpublic information and impaired objectivity. It also requests input on strategies for mitigating these issues.

Additionally, the text touches on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, seeking input on how to overcome barriers and leverage underserved communities to partner with subcontractors and promote full participation in the performance of the requirement.

Overall, this text appears to be related to assessing the safety and integrity of hardware put into the National Bureau of Labor (NBL) for testing, training, or evaluation, while also considering organizational conflicts of interest and diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility."

All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) minimum specifications of the technical, performance, and functional characteristics of the proposed product; (2) technical support, customer support and delivery, installation, and set-up plan; (3) warranty and preventative maintenance agreement plan; (4) Past Performance; and (5) Price. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in herein. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirement as set forth herein. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors set forth above. The evaluation factors are used when reviewing the proposals: (1) Technical Capability and Functionality—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for overall capability and functionality in relation to the General Requirement, Salient Characteristics, Quantity and Deliverables as described in the Purchase Description; (2) Contract Management and Customer Support—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide a high level of customer service, particularly in the area of initial responsiveness and resolution of device and service problems; (3) Speed of Delivery, Installation and Set-up—NIDA shall evaluate the offeror’s technical approach for completeness, feasibility, soundness and practicality of the proposed approach and work plan for accomplishing the requirements of the statement of work; (4) Past Performance—Offerors will be evaluated based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. Furthermore, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information; and (5) Price— Offerors price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques. Price evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror determined to be technically unacceptable. Offerors may respond with a proposal indicating their ability to provide the technical specifications stated in this solicitation. Responses will be evaluated based on the contractor’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision) x.        The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (September 2023), applies to this acquisition. xi.        The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items (December 2022), applies to this acquisition. xii.        The provision of FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (September 2023), applies to this acquisition. xiii.        There are no additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions applicable to this acquisition. xiv.       The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement. xv.         Responses to this solicitation must include sufficient information to establish the interested parties’ bona-fide capabilities of providing the product or service.  Responses to this solicitation must include clear and convincing evidence of the Offeror’s capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the government requirements stated in this solicitation.  Basic cost and price information in the Offeror’s proposal must contain sufficient information to allow the Government to perform a basic analysis of the reasonableness of the Offeror to supply the required goods/services. Any other information or factors that may be considered in the award decision may include such factors as: past performance; special features required for effective service coverage; trade-in considerations; warranty considerations; maintenance and service coverage availability; serial, product or catalog number(s); product description; delivery terms; and prompt payment discount terms.

Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). ____________________________________________________________________________ Background: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Operations Contract II (NOC II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to, support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA NOC, contract #80JSC017C0001. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). Under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,000. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all categories of Large Business, Small Business (SB), all socioeconomic categories of Small Business and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (ED-WOSB) or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses received. NOC II Description: The proposed NOC II contract will provide operational support services to the NBL. It is anticipated that the NOC II will be a single-award, Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion Form contract with an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity feature. The current NOC IDIQ feature represents approximately 30% of contract value, and it is anticipated that NOC II will maintain a similar percentage of IDIQ contract value. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and/or Firm-Fixed-Price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the current NOC Statement of Work (SOW) and Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) are attached to this posting. NASA anticipates releasing the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs within several weeks. It is anticipated that there will be some changes between the NOC SOW and DRDs and the NOC II SOW and DRDs. Interested parties are encouraged to carefully review the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs for changes upon their release.   The NBL is a key Agency asset that supports human space flight training by simulating weightless and partial gravity environments through underwater diving operations. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time mission troubleshooting, flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support of external customers. Because of the NBL’s importance to the NASA mission, and the highly hazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to agency management and the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics and Mockup Facility (LMF) that provides fabrication, repair, and maintenance of mockups. The NBL is operated by JSC’s Flight Operations Directorate (FOD). The NBL currently supports the International Space Station (ISS), Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, and Lunar Surface operations), other NASA space programs, and other JSC directorates (e.g. Engineering, Health and Human Performance, and Public Affairs). In addition to the JSC directorates, the NBL also supports other NASA field centers, other Government agencies (e.g. U.S. Coast Guard), and commercial companies. The support provided includes the use of the NBL for submerged and surface activities. The LMF is also available to provide hardware repairs or modifications to increase productivity in the NBL. The mockups used in the NBL are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft, spacecraft components, or lunar surface features. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from “low fidelity”, which models the basic volume and shape of the item, to “high fidelity” which very closely matches the “look and feel” of the item. Mockups can be built to last briefly (e.g. for short-term engineering evaluations) or for many years. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics and are intended for multi-year use. JSC is eager to support and partner with the burgeoning Commercial Spaceflight Industry and recognizes that the NBL provides unique capabilities that may be helpful to many entities. NASA anticipates incentivizing the successful support of external customers but anticipates little to no active recruitment of new customers due to the expected high utilization of the NBL during the period of performance of NOC II. However, NASA wants to ensure that new customers can be recruited if utilization falls below expected levels. Note that NASA anticipates significant changes to the External Customer metrics and incentives under the NOC II requirement from those in the attached NOC SOW and DRDs. The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: Raytheon Company Contract Number: 80JSC017C0001 Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $160M Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2024 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: 1. Technical - Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the current NOC SOW. Please identify specific SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. If subcontracting or if a joint venture is anticipated, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture partners and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. 2. Small Business – If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the current NOC SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. 3. General –        a. What additional documents would you like to see on the NOC II contract website or included in the Technical Library?        b. What barriers or obstacles do you foresee to potentially bidding on this contract? Can you identify any Government                  acquisition approaches that would increase the competitiveness of this procurement?        c. Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon,               what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages?        d. Due to NBL limited excess capacity, NASA anticipates little to no active recruitment of new external customers. What flexible incentive mechanisms would you suggest that would enable NASA to incentivize future recruitment of external customers if unanticipated excess capacity became available?       e. NBL divers and other operations personnel bring tremendous value to human spaceflight through their training and experience. With increasing opportunities in commercial space and other related fields, recruitment and retention of these highly skilled operators is crucial. How can the contract be structured to best enable this? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies?       f. What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure?       g. Provide feedback and rationale on any other topics, factors, and/or items of interest you would like to address regarding this potential procurement. 4. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: a. Name and address of the firm’s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) b.

If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The JSC Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the NOC II acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the NOC II may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for NOC II. Specifically, NASA anticipates the effort under NOC II will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Provide assessments of the safety or readiness of commercial suit vendors to integrate and perform testing in the NBL Potential access to data from other commercial companies or government agencies acquired through integrating and assessing the safety of hardware put into the NBL for testing, training, or evaluation Potential access to assessment data for hardware tested, trained, or evaluated in the NBL Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated NOC II contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the NOC II contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract Potential impaired objectivity if the NOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g. affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA’s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf    Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the NOC II contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed NOC II contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the NOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential NOC II Request for Proposal (RFP)? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. Companies are cautioned to consider OCI when responding to this RFI, and to consider internal mitigation measures that would prevent OCI from adversely affecting a company’s future procurement prospects. NASA is not in a position to respond to Offerors on the existence of OCI or remedial measures. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Offerors will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its OCI submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP.   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.   Additionally, in support of EO 13985, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of ""equity."" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. NASA seeks input in the following areas: To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g. outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Operations Contract II (NOC II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to, support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA NOC, contract #80JSC017C0001. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). Under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,000. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all categories of Large Business, Small Business (SB), all socioeconomic categories of Small Business and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (ED-WOSB) or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses received. NOC II Description: The proposed NOC II contract will provide operational support services to the NBL. It is anticipated that the NOC II will be a single-award, Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion Form contract with an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity feature. The current NOC IDIQ feature represents approximately 30% of contract value, and it is anticipated that NOC II will maintain a similar percentage of IDIQ contract value. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and/or Firm-Fixed-Price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the current NOC Statement of Work (SOW) and Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) are attached to this posting. NASA anticipates releasing the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs within several weeks. It is anticipated that there will be some changes between the NOC SOW and DRDs and the NOC II SOW and DRDs. Interested parties are encouraged to carefully review the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs for changes upon their release.   The NBL is a key Agency asset that supports human space flight training by simulating weightless and partial gravity environments through underwater diving operations. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time mission troubleshooting, flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support of external customers. Because of the NBL’s importance to the NASA mission, and the highly hazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to agency management and the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics and Mockup Facility (LMF) that provides fabrication, repair, and maintenance of mockups. The NBL is operated by JSC’s Flight Operations Directorate (FOD). The NBL currently supports the International Space Station (ISS), Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, and Lunar Surface operations), other NASA space programs, and other JSC directorates (e.g. Engineering, Health and Human Performance, and Public Affairs). In addition to the JSC directorates, the NBL also supports other NASA field centers, other Government agencies (e.g. U.S. Coast Guard), and commercial companies. The support provided includes the use of the NBL for submerged and surface activities. The LMF is also available to provide hardware repairs or modifications to increase productivity in the NBL. The mockups used in the NBL are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft, spacecraft components, or lunar surface features. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from “low fidelity”, which models the basic volume and shape of the item, to “high fidelity” which very closely matches the “look and feel” of the item. Mockups can be built to last briefly (e.g. for short-term engineering evaluations) or for many years. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics and are intended for multi-year use. JSC is eager to support and partner with the burgeoning Commercial Spaceflight Industry and recognizes that the NBL provides unique capabilities that may be helpful to many entities. NASA anticipates incentivizing the successful support of external customers but anticipates little to no active recruitment of new customers due to the expected high utilization of the NBL during the period of performance of NOC II. However, NASA wants to ensure that new customers can be recruited if utilization falls below expected levels. Note that NASA anticipates significant changes to the External Customer metrics and incentives under the NOC II requirement from those in the attached NOC SOW and DRDs. The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: Raytheon Company Contract Number: 80JSC017C0001 Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $160M Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2024 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: 1. Technical - Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the current NOC SOW. Please identify specific SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. If subcontracting or if a joint venture is anticipated, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture partners and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. 2. Small Business – If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the current NOC SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. 3. General –        a. What additional documents would you like to see on the NOC II contract website or included in the Technical Library?        b. What barriers or obstacles do you foresee to potentially bidding on this contract? Can you identify any Government                  acquisition approaches that would increase the competitiveness of this procurement?        c. Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon,               what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years?

The JSC Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the NOC II acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the NOC II may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for NOC II. Specifically, NASA anticipates the effort under NOC II will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Provide assessments of the safety or readiness of commercial suit vendors to integrate and perform testing in the NBL Potential access to data from other commercial companies or government agencies acquired through integrating and assessing the safety of hardware put into the NBL for testing, training, or evaluation Potential access to assessment data for hardware tested, trained, or evaluated in the NBL Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated NOC II contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the NOC II contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract Potential impaired objectivity if the NOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g. affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA’s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf    Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the NOC II contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed NOC II contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the NOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential NOC II Request for Proposal (RFP)? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. Companies are cautioned to consider OCI when responding to this RFI, and to consider internal mitigation measures that would prevent OCI from adversely affecting a company’s future procurement prospects. NASA is not in a position to respond to Offerors on the existence of OCI or remedial measures. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Offerors will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its OCI submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP.   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.   Additionally, in support of EO 13985, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of ""equity."" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. NASA seeks input in the following areas: To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g. outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the NOC II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 20 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 20-page limitation. The OCI Mitigation Plan should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI Mitigation Plan submittal. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on March 06, 2023.

60351,Partnering Opportunity for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) vehicles Modular Assembled Radiators for NEP Vehicle (MARVL),SS_LaRC_2023_ECI-01,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION,,,2023-04-26,,,https://sam.gov/opp/cf06e4e03c0d4b42bc4ac77cde7c59d9/view,"NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information from potential partners to participate in a proposal development activity that will design, develop, build, and ground demonstrate autonomous assembly of multiple sub-scale radiator modules with fluidic, mechanical, and electrical interfaces for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) vehicles. Modular Assembled Radiators for NEP Vehicle (MARVL) project is an Early Career Initiative (ECI) sponsored by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and was released on March 1, 2023. The deadline for partnering responses is  May 3, 2023. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LaRC is seeking participation with this partnering synopsis from all interested U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are also encouraged to apply. Additionally, in support of the Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is also looking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities to access procurement opportunities. Underserved Communities include Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASA’s policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. The Early Career Initiative is an internal NASA call for space technology development and demonstration proposals that foster the next step in the professional development of early career NASA technologists by providing cutting-edge hands-on space technology hardware development opportunities.  This initiative promotes creative joint partnering within highly collaborative work environments between the best and brightest NASA early career innovators and while teaming with world-class industry, academia, and other government organizations.  Proposing teams will include a core team, including NASA and external partner members and at least half of the core team must consist of NASA early career employees.  A NASA early career employee must lead the project (Project Lead) and shall engage an experienced NASA mentor, and a STMD mentor who will be identified after selection of the project.  Other roles (e.g., Project Manager, Project Scientist) can be filled by team members from NASA or partner.  The general approach will be to employ agile systems engineering methods emphasizing working products, collaboration, iterative, hands-on testing, and responsiveness to change rather than formal process and documentation with milestone-based assessments including a continuation review at the development site and a final presentation to NASA Headquarters.  If a project wishes to involve a foreign organization, prior confirmation is needed.  Teams must propose innovative space hardware-focused projects lasting no more than 2 years and costing up to $1.25M per year in total (25-45% for external partners) for all cost including procurement and labor.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners to participate in developing proposals for and collaborating on potential Early Career Initiative (ECI) projects. LaRC is pursuing several topic areas that align with NASA’s space technology priorities and involve a variety of technical areas that could benefit from partnering. The partner can propose to the technical challenge provided below: Long duration space flight is a requirement for missions to both the Moon and Mars. One candidate for propulsion is Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). This form of propulsion generates high levels of heat and requires large scale radiators. NEP vehicles have the potential to be on the same size order or larger than the International Space Station (ISS).  The required radiating area, based on current mission requirements, will be the largest proposed space structure even conceived at around 2500 m2 (an order of magnitude larger than the radiating area on the ISS).  The large radiator size required for NEP vehicles negates the feasibility of utilizing conventional deployable radiator designs and will also greatly exceed current launch vehicle volumetric capacities. An alternate method to assemble structures of this size is to explore autonomous in-space assembly of modular units. Development of modular autonomously assembled radiators would not only advance NEP vehicle concepts but is also extensible to a multitude of other space and surface-based applications. The Modular Assembly Radiators for NEP VehicLes (MARVL) ECI project will address both the required design and in-space assembly, with a focus on autonomous assembly, of a potential radiator design. The project will conduct research and development efforts into radiator design for a candidate NEP vehicle. The team will then design small-scale modular units that can be assembled to produce the size radiator that is needed. The units will then be simplified for use in a ground demonstration of a modular assembled radiator. Utilization of prior knowledge of autonomous assembly or robotic assembly will be crucial for project success. This work will also include development in fluid loop and reversable coupler technology with focus on autonomous assembly. The following objectives will be addressed by the program: Investigate the trade space for an NEP vehicle with in-space assembled radiators and propose configurations Design and develop a radiator module for in-space assembly Investigate and determine fluid/mechanical/electric coupler connection between radiator modules Develop and concept of operations for autonomous in-space assembled radiators Perform relevant subscale demonstration of autonomous in-space assembled radiator Develop autonomous leak checking and verification of connections The partner must provide expertise in at least one of the fields described below and must have the personnel and facilities required to perform any necessary software or hardware testing. The ideal partner may also contribute some, but not all, work or resources to the project in-kind, which should be described within the partner’s proposal submission. Ideal academic partner candidates should have experience in the fields of heat rejection systems, radiator design, autonomy, robotics and/or software development with personnel and facilities required to develop and test the autonomy packages using relevant hardware developed among partners. Ideal industry partner candidates should also have experience in heat rejection systems, radiator design fluid loop development, reversable fluid coupler design, autonomy, in-space assembly, and/or modular design. Knowledge in fluid loop radiator technology and build will also be desired.   This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) technical requirements, conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, and cost estimates. If the proposal is subsequently selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selected partner(s) for the performance of the proposed tasks. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria: Technical Qualifications of the External Partner (30 points): This criterion evaluates the technical expertise/capabilities; and innovativeness of the external partner in leading and/or executing activities related to the topics above; and the resources (skills and time) that would be allocated to the potential proposal development phase. Management Approach (25 points): This criterion evaluates how the management approach is different from standard NASA practices, evaluates whether it represents a successful approach from another industry or organization and shows understanding of the alternative approach.  The criterion will also explain how the management approach applies to your project and the degree to which it increases the probability of successfully executing the work plan. Assessment of the practicality and efficiency of the project schedule and requested resources. Teaming and Workforce Approach (25 points):  This criterion evaluates the integration of capabilities across the core team members relative to the work plan. Agile Approaches Used in the Past (20 points): This criterion evaluates the external partner’s past experience in developing and utilizing agile development principles: using development methods that emphasize working products; collaboration; iterative, hands-on testing; and responsiveness to change rather than formal processes and documentation. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on SAM.gov.  Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 5 pages indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

60471,Partnering Opportunity for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) vehicles Modular Assembled Radiators for NEP Vehicle (MARVL),SS_LaRC_2023_ECI-01,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION,,,2023-04-18,,,https://sam.gov/opp/c4ac09fb4f0c45418988897e1315ade1/view,"NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information from potential partners to participate in a proposal development activity that will design, develop, build, and ground demonstrate autonomous assembly of multiple sub-scale radiator modules with fluidic, mechanical, and electrical interfaces for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) vehicles. Modular Assembled Radiators for NEP Vehicle (MARVL) project is an Early Career Initiative (ECI) sponsored by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and was released on March 1, 2023. The deadline for partnering responses is April 27, 2023. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LaRC is seeking participation with this partnering synopsis from all interested U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are also encouraged to apply. Additionally, in support of the Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is also looking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities to access procurement opportunities. Underserved Communities include Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASA’s policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. The Early Career Initiative is an internal NASA call for space technology development and demonstration proposals that foster the next step in the professional development of early career NASA technologists by providing cutting-edge hands-on space technology hardware development opportunities.  This initiative promotes creative joint partnering within highly collaborative work environments between the best and brightest NASA early career innovators and while teaming with world-class industry, academia, and other government organizations.  Proposing teams will include a core team, including NASA and external partner members and at least half of the core team must consist of NASA early career employees.  A NASA early career employee must lead the project (Project Lead) and shall engage an experienced NASA mentor, and a STMD mentor who will be identified after selection of the project.  Other roles (e.g., Project Manager, Project Scientist) can be filled by team members from NASA or partner.  The general approach will be to employ agile systems engineering methods emphasizing working products, collaboration, iterative, hands-on testing, and responsiveness to change rather than formal process and documentation with milestone-based assessments including a continuation review at the development site and a final presentation to NASA Headquarters.  If a project wishes to involve a foreign organization, prior confirmation is needed.  Teams must propose innovative space hardware-focused projects lasting no more than 2 years and costing up to $1.25M per year in total (25-45% for external partners) for all cost including procurement and labor.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners to participate in developing proposals for and collaborating on potential Early Career Initiative (ECI) projects. LaRC is pursuing several topic areas that align with NASA’s space technology priorities and involve a variety of technical areas that could benefit from partnering. The partner can propose to the technical challenge provided below: Long duration space flight is a requirement for missions to both the Moon and Mars. One candidate for propulsion is Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). This form of propulsion generates high levels of heat and requires large scale radiators. NEP vehicles have the potential to be on the same size order or larger than the International Space Station (ISS).  The required radiating area, based on current mission requirements, will be the largest proposed space structure even conceived at around 2500 m2 (an order of magnitude larger than the radiating area on the ISS).  The large radiator size required for NEP vehicles negates the feasibility of utilizing conventional deployable radiator designs and will also greatly exceed current launch vehicle volumetric capacities. An alternate method to assemble structures of this size is to explore autonomous in-space assembly of modular units. Development of modular autonomously assembled radiators would not only advance NEP vehicle concepts but is also extensible to a multitude of other space and surface-based applications. The Modular Assembly Radiators for NEP VehicLes (MARVL) ECI project will address both the required design and in-space assembly, with a focus on autonomous assembly, of a potential radiator design. The project will conduct research and development efforts into radiator design for a candidate NEP vehicle. The team will then design small-scale modular units that can be assembled to produce the size radiator that is needed. The units will then be simplified for use in a ground demonstration of a modular assembled radiator. Utilization of prior knowledge of autonomous assembly or robotic assembly will be crucial for project success. This work will also include development in fluid loop and reversable coupler technology with focus on autonomous assembly. The following objectives will be addressed by the program: Investigate the trade space for an NEP vehicle with in-space assembled radiators and propose configurations Design and develop a radiator module for in-space assembly Investigate and determine fluid/mechanical/electric coupler connection between radiator modules Develop and concept of operations for autonomous in-space assembled radiators Perform relevant subscale demonstration of autonomous in-space assembled radiator Develop autonomous leak checking and verification of connections The partner must provide expertise in at least one of the fields described below and must have the personnel and facilities required to perform any necessary software or hardware testing. The ideal partner may also contribute some, but not all, work or resources to the project in-kind, which should be described within the partner’s proposal submission. Ideal academic partner candidates should have experience in the fields of heat rejection systems, radiator design, autonomy, robotics and/or software development with personnel and facilities required to develop and test the autonomy packages using relevant hardware developed among partners. Ideal industry partner candidates should also have experience in heat rejection systems, radiator design fluid loop development, reversable fluid coupler design, autonomy, in-space assembly, and/or modular design. Knowledge in fluid loop radiator technology and build will also be desired.   This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) technical requirements, conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, and cost estimates. If the proposal is subsequently selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selected partner(s) for the performance of the proposed tasks. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria: Technical Qualifications of the External Partner (30 points): This criterion evaluates the technical expertise/capabilities; and innovativeness of the external partner in leading and/or executing activities related to the topics above; and the resources (skills and time) that would be allocated to the potential proposal development phase. Management Approach (25 points): This criterion evaluates how the management approach is different from standard NASA practices, evaluates whether it represents a successful approach from another industry or organization and shows understanding of the alternative approach.  The criterion will also explain how the management approach applies to your project and the degree to which it increases the probability of successfully executing the work plan. Assessment of the practicality and efficiency of the project schedule and requested resources. Teaming and Workforce Approach (25 points):  This criterion evaluates the integration of capabilities across the core team members relative to the work plan. Agile Approaches Used in the Past (20 points): This criterion evaluates the external partner’s past experience in developing and utilizing agile development principles: using development methods that emphasize working products; collaboration; iterative, hands-on testing; and responsiveness to change rather than formal processes and documentation. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on SAM.gov.  Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 5 pages indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The responses should use 12-point font for each technical area of interest (i.e. offerors responding to one or more of the mission elements may submit up to 5 pages per each element). Responses shall also address each of the evaluation criteria listed above.  Resumes of key personnel and a cover page that clearly identifies the topic area addressed by the response do not count against the total allocated page count.

68563,TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITY: Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LAR-TOPS-73),T2P-LaRC-00065,NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION,,,2020-11-30,,,https://sam.gov/opp/a85ac57685f84a2caba0fa37ef8f6d26/view,"NASA’s Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA's Langley Research Center offers a novel lifting and precision positioning device with hybrid functional characteristics of both crane-type lifting devices and robotic manipulators. The design of the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS) allows for fine positioning with complete control over both translation and rotation of the payload. In addition, the design permits several other operations using a wide variety of special purpose tools, such as a bucket, pallet forks, grappling devices, sensor and visualization packages, and dexterous robotic arms that can be quickly added to the tip. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees. NASA Langley developed the LSMS because of the need for a versatile system capable of performing multiple functions on the lunar surface, such as unloading components from a lander, transporting components to an operational site and installing them, and supporting service and replacement during component life. Current devices used for in-space operations are designed to work on orbit (zero g) only and thus do not have sufficient strength to operate on planetary surfaces. Traditional cranes are specialized to the task of lifting and are not capable of manipulator-type positioning operations. The innovations incorporated into the LSMS allow it to lower payloads to the ground over a significant portion of the workspace without use of a hoist, functioning like a robot manipulator, thus providing a rigid connection and very precise control of the payload. The LSMS uses a truss architecture with pure compression and tension members to achieve a lightweight design. The innovation of using multiple spreaders (like spokes in a wheel) allows the LSMS to maintain its high structural efficiency throughout its full range of motion. Rod portions of the tension members automatically lift off and re-engage the spreaders as the joint articulates, allowing a large range of motion while maintaining mechanical advantage. In addition, the LSMS uses a quick-change device at the tip end that enables automated acquisition of end effectors or special purpose tools to increase its versatility. To express interest in this opportunity, please submit a license application through NASA’s Automated Technology Licensing Application System (ATLAS) by visiting https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LAR-TOPS-73 If you have any questions, please e-mail NASA’s Technology Transfer Program at Agency-Patent-Licensing@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this beta.SAM.gov notice and your preferred contact information. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at https://technology.nasa.gov/ These responses are provided to members of NASA’s Technology Transfer Program for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities.
