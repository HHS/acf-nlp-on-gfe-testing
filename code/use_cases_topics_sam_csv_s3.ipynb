(d)Â Agreement.Â When awarded a contract action, including orders under multiple-award contracts, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpartÂ 819.70Â and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and part 125, including the non-manufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR 121.406(b) and 13 CFR 125.6. Unless otherwise stated in this clause, a requirement in 13 CFR parts 121 and 125 that applies to an SDVO SBC, is to be construed to also apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. For the purpose of limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs (including independent contractors) shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e.,Â a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to comply with the required certification requirements in this solicitation (see 852.219-75 or 852.219-76 as applicable). These requirements are summarized as follows: (1)Â Services.Â In the case of a contract for services (except construction), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs (excluding direct costs to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and the SDVOSB/VOSB does not provide the service, such as airline travel, cloud computing services, or mass media purchases). When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the service portion of the contract (2)Â Supplies/products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. When a contract includes both supply and services, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the supply portion of the contract. (ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a non-manufacturer, the SDVOSB prime contractor will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in 13 CFR 121.406(b)(5) has been granted. Refer to 13 CRF 125.6(a)(2)(ii) for guidance pertaining to multiple item procurements. (3)Â General construction.Â In the case of a contract for general construction, the SDVOSB prime contractor will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (4)Â Special trade construction contractors.Â In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, may be paid to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5)Â Subcontracting.Â An SDVOSB must meet the NAICS size standard assigned by the prime contractor and be listed in VIP to count as similarly situated. Any work that a first tier VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, the cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. When a contract includes both services and supplies, the 50 percent limitation shall apply only to the portion of the contract with the preponderance of the expenditure upon which the assigned NAICS is based. For information and more specific requirements, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e)Â Required limitations on subcontracting compliance measurement period.Â An SDVOSB shall comply with the limitations on subcontracting as follows: [Contracting Officer check as appropriate.] __By the end of the base term of the contract or order, and then by the end of each subsequent option period; or __By the end of the performance period for each order issued under the contract. (f)Â Joint ventures.Â A joint venture may be considered eligible as an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any requirement therein that applies to an SDVO SBC is to be construed to apply to a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (g)Â Precedence.Â The VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR 802.101, subpartÂ 819.70, and this clause, takes precedence over any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA Program for SDVO SBCs, and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program. (h)Â Misrepresentation.Â Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), any business concern, including all its principals, that is determined by VA to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented a company's SDVOSB status is subject to debarment from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years (see VAAR 809.406-2 Causes for Debarment).

This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/ subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/ created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. f.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office (NCO 21) is soliciting information from contractors that can furnish a survey Using Innovative Data Tools to Understand, Predict, and Prepare for the Impacts of Climate Change on Veteran Health. Description of Work Required: Climate change increasingly affects every aspect of human life. Ongoing studies continue to report a close correlation between climate change and human health. It is estimated that global death rates will increase by 73 per 100,000 people by 2100 due to changes in temperature alone. Recent findings suggest that the health impacts of climate change are primarily related to underlying risk factors, such as chronic disease, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposure to other health stressors. Based on limited data, initial prediction scenarios suggest that many prevalent climate change impacts correlate with an increase in negative health outcomes. Beyond the direct effects on human health, it is also now established that as climate change affects the physical environment, the distribution and prevalence of certain infectious diseases will increase, resulting in increasing healthcare demand. The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate change scientists, particularly with respect to Lyme disease and other vector-borne human diseases. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate change and disease, along with historical and experimental evidence, suggest that climate change can affect disease outbreaks and overall human health in nonlinear ways. The increasing negative effects from climate change could have extraordinary implications for the VA in terms of Veteran health, care delivery, health equity, emergency preparedness and response, and overall VA facility and health care costs. Recent trends in U.S. climate data demonstrate that extreme temperature events (both hot and cold) are becoming more frequent. Environmental factors have the potential to significantly impact healthcare delivery: a 2023 study found that large portions of the U.S. could experience electric grid strains coinciding with periods of extreme heat, leading to large surges in emergency department visits with the potential to overwhelm hospitals resources. Extreme temperatures will likely worsen chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease, and septicemia. This could especially harm the many Veterans that are predisposed to poor health outcomes to due to additional underlying risk factors such as chronic medical conditions, poverty, and homelessness. To fully understand the implications of these changes, more data integration and analysis is needed to correlate climate change and health effects and to project future climate impacts on VHA healthcare delivery. Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, established a comprehensive government approach to the climate crisis, requiring each government agency to develop a Climate Action Plan (CAP). The 2021 VA CAP outlined five specific climate vulnerabilities, with two directly addressing the public health impacts of climate change, related to a) the increased demand for emergency care and supplies during dangerous natural disasters related to climate change, and b) the adverse human health impacts to Veterans (and VA employees) of climate-related environmental changes, such as heat waves, floods, droughts and other extreme events, leading to direct health effects as well as food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, changes in the quality and safety of air, food, water and stresses to mental health. Fortunately, new tools and resources are now available to provide innovative insights into these issues that will allow for better strategic approaches and strategy development. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have accelerated the adoption of algorithmically-enhanced data platforms and services and present an opportunity to gain high-fidelity insights into community-specific risk factors, including social and demographic data at varying geographic scales (national, state, region, neighborhood, and individual), such as wealth, education, physical environment, infrastructure, food, connection, safety, health care access, housing, and various other lifestyle and preference data for most adults across the U.S. These datasets include risk indicators for various disease states and conditions (such as homelessness), and sophisticated predictive algorithms that can be deployed across the data sets to model risk. New, high-resolution climate models are also available to allow for predictive capabilities at the community and individual levels that can be integrated with Veteran demographic data, creating a first-of-its-kind 360-degree assessment of climate impacts on Veteran populations. When combined with existing Veterans Health Administration (VHA) veteran health data sources, these new analytical approaches could provide the most high-resolution insights ever achieved to understand the complex relationships between climate change and Veteran health. These insights can then be used to inform better healthcare delivery, pandemic preparedness, and allocation of healthcare resources as well as project non-linear growth in VA healthcare costs. These analytics could also shape alerting programs that could notify VHA public health experts before or during impending or developing public health concerns.

These analytics could also shape alerting programs that could notify VHA public health experts before or during impending or developing public health concerns. PURPOSE: 1.2.2 VHA PHNPO s intent is to leverage the resources described above to innovate an integrated public health surveillance platform and analytics tool combining Veteran medical record data, evidence-based climate data and forecasting, and Veteran demographic data, and conduct a pilot effort to evaluate climate and Veteran health forecast scenarios as follows: Employ the novel data and algorithmic platform, JUPITER, to build on the recent work, Analysis of Correlation between Climate Change and Human Health Based on a Machine Learning Approach to develop high-fidelity community-level climate and health risk profiles for three U.S. counties (at least one rural and one urban/large metropolitan city) using existing VA datasets. Jupiter Intelligence is the global market, science, and technology leader in physical climate analytics for resiliency planning, risk management, and disclosure. Jupiter s customers include five percent of the world s largest enterprises, many companies within the Global 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense, and public sector authorities in jurisdictions around the world. Its analytics have been adopted by at least one of the world s five largest entities in asset management, banking, chemicals, insurance, oil and gas, minerals and mining, electric utilities, and construction. Disclosed private sector customers include AstraZeneca, BP, Entergy, Hawaiian Electric, JLL, Liberty Mutual, MS&AD, Nephila and Zurich Insurance. In addition to the DoD, Jupiter s public-sector work includes FEMA, NASA, NOAA, New York City, the City of Miami, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Broward County (Florida), and national security agencies. Jupiter s partnerships include most of the world s largest accounting, consulting, engineering and insurance firms, and defense contractors, including Aon, Bain, Boston Consulting Group, Guide house (formerly Navigant), MS&AD, and Zurich Insurance. The Jupiter Promise program partners with NGOs to provide climate analytics to improve resilience for the world s most vulnerable, under-resourced populations. Jupiter s enterprise-grade, best-in-science solutions Climate Score Global, and the Climate Score Planning suite together form the world s only global-to-street resolution climate analytics offering. Their foundation, the Jupiter Climate Score Intelligence Platform, is based on rigorous global climate, weather, ocean, hydrological, and data science, and transparent methodologies. Use historical, longitudinal climate data and metrics derived from the integrated with Veteran medical record data to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot to determine the empirical relationship between climate change and three highly impactful chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma/emphysema, heart disease, and kidney disease) that are prevalent among Veterans. The pilot will be constructed using the risk profiles developed in Phase 1 and will incorporate anonymized individual medical record-level Veteran health data from the VHA medical record database. Utilizing the empirical relationships developed in Phase 2, use high-resolution climate forecasts based on modeling of three future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) to project climate impacts on the chronic health conditions evaluated in Phase 2. This approach can quantify physical climate risk anywhere in the world down to a 90-m resolution. It employs dozens of the scientific community s most respected climate models, coupled with machine learning, land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, severe weather, and more. The hazard output parameters include inland flooding, coastal flooding, heat, cold, wind, precipitation, drought, hail, and other severe weather, and wildfire. All climate hazards will incorporate similar components, which fall into two categories: those used to calculate future extreme hazards at a broad level, and those used to downscale those projections to the local level. Use the projections developed in Phase 3 to identify correlations between climate change and specific health conditions affecting Veterans to inform policies and interventions and model potential interventions that VHA could deploy to mitigate the risks identified, including outlining the additional resources that VHA will require to meet the needs of Veterans as demand for healthcare services grow with worsening environmental conditions. This four-pronged approach seeks to ensure the following: that VHA takes advantage of newly available climate and data technology resources to use longitudinal climate data below the zip code level to develop high-fidelity community risk profiles; that the pilots be conducted in >3 different locations (urban and rural) to ensure learning, cross-pollination, and evaluation of multiple potentially vulnerable Veteran populations; and that the test and evaluate approach facilitates an iterative transition to scale and ultimately impacts Veterans lives. VA s integration of an advanced analytics platform with existing VA and other supplemental data resources would allow for a real-time view of potential climate change-induced risk factors that may exacerbate or cause adverse health outcomes in Veterans. We plan to develop, integrate, and leverage an advanced analytics platform to inform development, implementation, evaluation, and scaling of a pilot program. To assess the most relevant and high-resolution climate intelligence, we will utilize advanced climate projections that can quantify the risk to populations due to changing environmental conditions across the entire U.S., including noncontiguous states and territories. For example, new ML and AI tools can determine how changes in the climate cause future flooding, extreme heat and cold, high winds, drought, and wildfires at 90-meter resolutions. The model products are determined by employing data from dozens of well-vetted climate models, coupled with land use and elevation data, and models for hydrology, wildfire, and severe weather to analyze trends in future climate scenarios. These outputs can quantify risk due to environmental perils in 5-year increments from 2020 through 2100, for three potential carbon emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). Over the past few years, organizations have leveraged data-driven insights from advanced analytics to make more informed and effective decisions. As technology has advanced, AI and ML techniques have been used to gain a more comprehensive and nuanced view of community behavior, allowing organizations to predict future trends, tailor healthcare strategies, and measure the effectiveness of their engagement efforts while optimizing resource allocation. Similarly, by pursuing the example activities and developing the outputs described above, the VHA PHNPO can not only better serve Veterans most vulnerable to the impacts of increasingly severe chronic health conditions in the near-term but can also realize the long-term benefits of yet-untapped AI and ML advances that can enhance understanding of community risks, develop predictive risk modeling, create tailored interventions, and measure engagement impacts. This will also help the PHNPO contribute to the broader community s understanding of how climate change changes environmental conditions and affects health risk factors for all Americans. 1.2.3 The Climate Action Plan also specifies that, in addition to preparing and deploying enhanced bio surveillance systems and epidemiologic investigations to better understand and address climate-related impacts, another key action required to prepare for the impact of climate change on Veteran health is readiness of critical supply and pharmaceutical stockpiles. The All-Hazards Emergency Cache (AHEC) comprised of Emergency Pharmacy Services (EPS), Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and PHNPO (Lead), provides short-term coverage for the initial 48-72 hours of a large-scale emergency and complements the contents of the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile managed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise. Increases in temperatures and precipitation extremes are projected to result in extreme weather events, and climate change is also likely to change the epidemiology of certain infectious diseases. Resulting natural disasters, large-scale emergencies, and pandemics will stress local supplies on hand and potentially interrupt supply chain activities. VA relies on these stockpiles to respond to the impact of surges in the demand for supplies and to mitigate impacts of high consequence infections. VA is also prepared to participate in regional disaster planning and response, as part of VA s Fourth Mission activities under the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. Ch. 68). PHNPO must be prepared to adapt and update AHEC, as needed, to respond to the effects of climate change on disease transmission, and to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the AHEC program itself. 1.3 Period of Performance: Date of award to one (1) year. 1.4 Place of Performance: TBD 1.5 Hours of Operation: TBD 1.6 Type of Contract: TBD 1.7 Invoicing: All invoices from the contractor shall be submitted electronically in accordance with VAAR Clause 852.232-72 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.

      "Sample 4: ***** This is a REQUEST FOR INTEREST ONLY! This request does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. The intent of this request is to identify potential offerors for market research purposes only. ***** Request for Information (RFI) Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), which manages and operates portions of the Savannah River Site (SRS) under a Department of Energy (DOE) prime contract, solicits expressions of interest from potential suppliers with the experience, capability, and capacity to provide drum handling equipment. ­­­­ This RFI is issued to assist with finding potential suppliers interested in this solicitation. The SRS is located approximately 15 miles south of Aiken, South Carolina and is 310 contiguous square miles. Scope Summary Background The K-Area Complex (KAC) Drum handling warehouse (DHW) is proposed to be a 170’ x 100’ permanent structure with conventional steel framing or pre-engineered metal framing system and a clear span width. It will be constructed to support the receipt, inspection, testing, and storage of up to 3600, 7A type A, stainless steel drums. A robotic inspection area and High-Pressure Lab (HPL) will also be installed in the DHW. The Material Balance Area (MBA) is the portion of the building where the 3600 drums will be stored, and it is proposed to occupy approximately 76’ x 100’ of the structure. See Figure 1 below for a pre-conceptual layout of the warehouse. Note: this layout does not specify exact location or sizes of these rooms to allow flexibility for the design agency. Task First, we are requesting information for an Inventory Management System (IMS) to manage the drum inventory located within the MBA inside the DHW. This will include entrance to and exit from the MBA. The input of drums into this system will be post robotic inspection. The drums will exit inspection and pass through a barrier in a manner to prohibit unauthorized access to the MBA for rack storage (or equivalent) and retrieval.  Upon Retrieval, the drums will exit through a barrier, in a manner to prohibit unauthorized access, for disposition. Ideally, this system will be a more “off the shelf” automated systems to manage the drums.  We will consider engineered solutions for the end effector on lift trucks but desire an automated system that is developed and ready to use out of the box. Second, include options for an automated system to unload incoming palletized drums from trucks and place pallets in the “New CCO (Criticality Control Overpack) holding area” as seen in figure 1. Ideally this system can also disposition individual drums that exit the MBA and load those individual drums onto outbound truck. Third, include options that can automate the drum removal from a wrapped and banded pallet as seen in figure 2. This system should have the option to remove the drum from the pallet and place onto a conveyor to feed the robotic inspection station. Please note: Our hopes are for a vendor to supply a complete suite of solutions, but we realize all vendors may not be able to offer a product meeting all tasks; we will accept information on any and all tasks. Inventory Management System Requirements 1.   Store individual, non-palletized, 7A type A, 55-gallon stainless steel drums 2.   Total storage capacity of approximately 3,600 drums 3.   Drum weight is approximately 230 lb. each. 4.   Rate: incoming drums 5/hour, outgoing 20/hour 5.   7,000 drums to be annually processed through the warehouse. 6.   Handling system must preclude damage to drums and maintain structural quality. 7.   System must support bi-annual physical/visual “hands on inventory” of every drum. 8.   System shall support some form of manual backup if the automation process fails. 9.   Available footprint if 76 ft x 100 ft clear span with a maximum storage height of 25 ft (dictated by the sprinkler system). 10. Must support First in First Out handling. 11. Drums may be stored horizontally or vertically. Loading and unloading requirements Unloading inbound: 1.   Unload 42 pallets per truck that are double stacked. 2.   Unload One truck at a time and place in designated staging area 3.   Scan barcode capability Loading outbound: 1.   Loose individual drums 2.   40 drums per truck 3.   One truck at the time 4.   Scan barcode capability A supplier's response to the RFI does not guarantee they will be selected to participate in the RFP. Suppliers responding to this RFI shall include evidence of the following: Supplier capability statement/personnel qualifications Manufacture specification sheet Standard lead time for delivery Past Performance relative to subject scope Budgetary Estimated cost Example photos and videos of similar work, if available E-mail response addressing Items 1 through 6 above shall be submitted (attachments in pdf format) by 5:00 p.m. est. on 5/16/24 to Barbara McCarty at barbara.mccarty@srs.gov..\n",

Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Operations Contract II (NOC II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to, support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA NOC, contract #80JSC017C0001. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). Under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,000. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all categories of Large Business, Small Business (SB), all socioeconomic categories of Small Business and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (ED-WOSB) or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses received. NOC II Description: The proposed NOC II contract will provide operational support services to the NBL. It is anticipated that the NOC II will be a single-award, Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion Form contract with an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity feature. The current NOC IDIQ feature represents approximately 30% of contract value, and it is anticipated that NOC II will maintain a similar percentage of IDIQ contract value. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and/or Firm-Fixed-Price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the current NOC Statement of Work (SOW) and Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) are attached to this posting. NASA anticipates releasing the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs within several weeks. It is anticipated that there will be some changes between the NOC SOW and DRDs and the NOC II SOW and DRDs. Interested parties are encouraged to carefully review the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs for changes upon their release.   The NBL is a key Agency asset that supports human space flight training by simulating weightless and partial gravity environments through underwater diving operations. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time mission troubleshooting, flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support of external customers. Because of the NBL’s importance to the NASA mission, and the highly hazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to agency management and the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics and Mockup Facility (LMF) that provides fabrication, repair, and maintenance of mockups. The NBL is operated by JSC’s Flight Operations Directorate (FOD). The NBL currently supports the International Space Station (ISS), Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, and Lunar Surface operations), other NASA space programs, and other JSC directorates (e.g. Engineering, Health and Human Performance, and Public Affairs). In addition to the JSC directorates, the NBL also supports other NASA field centers, other Government agencies (e.g. U.S. Coast Guard), and commercial companies. The support provided includes the use of the NBL for submerged and surface activities. The LMF is also available to provide hardware repairs or modifications to increase productivity in the NBL. The mockups used in the NBL are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft, spacecraft components, or lunar surface features. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from “low fidelity”, which models the basic volume and shape of the item, to “high fidelity” which very closely matches the “look and feel” of the item. Mockups can be built to last briefly (e.g. for short-term engineering evaluations) or for many years. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics and are intended for multi-year use. JSC is eager to support and partner with the burgeoning Commercial Spaceflight Industry and recognizes that the NBL provides unique capabilities that may be helpful to many entities. NASA anticipates incentivizing the successful support of external customers but anticipates little to no active recruitment of new customers due to the expected high utilization of the NBL during the period of performance of NOC II. However, NASA wants to ensure that new customers can be recruited if utilization falls below expected levels. Note that NASA anticipates significant changes to the External Customer metrics and incentives under the NOC II requirement from those in the attached NOC SOW and DRDs. The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: Raytheon Company Contract Number: 80JSC017C0001 Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $160M Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2024 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: 1. Technical - Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the current NOC SOW. Please identify specific SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement.

The JSC Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the NOC II acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the NOC II may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for NOC II. Specifically, NASA anticipates the effort under NOC II will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Provide assessments of the safety or readiness of commercial suit vendors to integrate and perform testing in the NBL Potential access to data from other commercial companies or government agencies acquired through integrating and assessing the safety of hardware put into the NBL for testing, training, or evaluation Potential access to assessment data for hardware tested, trained, or evaluated in the NBL Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated NOC II contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the NOC II contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract Potential impaired objectivity if the NOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g. affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA’s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf    Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the NOC II contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed NOC II contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the NOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential NOC II Request for Proposal (RFP)? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. Companies are cautioned to consider OCI when responding to this RFI, and to consider internal mitigation measures that would prevent OCI from adversely affecting a company’s future procurement prospects. NASA is not in a position to respond to Offerors on the existence of OCI or remedial measures. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Offerors will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its OCI submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP.   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.   Additionally, in support of EO 13985, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of \"equity.\" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. NASA seeks input in the following areas: To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g. outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it.

      "Sample 4: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RFI 36C10D24Q0038 1.0 INTRODUCTION THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for the Veterans Affairs Processing and Automation Services (VPAS). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only. There is no obligation for the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 15.201(E), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by VBA in developing its acquisition strategy and informing, refining, and finalizing the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response. Only electronic responses to this RFI will be accepted. The Government will not pay for any time expended or information submitted in response to this RFI. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this RFI. 2.0 BACKGROUND Through its three (3) administrations, National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Affairs (VA) administers vital services to America's Veterans. VA provides health care services, benefits programs, and access to national cemeteries for former military personnel and their dependents. The fundamental mission of VBA is to provide Veterans, transitioning service members, and their families with benefits and services including education benefits, home loans, life insurance, and disability compensation or pension benefits. Award of these benefits often requires information gathering from a multitude of third parties, government agencies and digital repositories as well as the application of complex rules. Prior to 2012, VBA processed most benefits utilizing paper claim folders. In September 2012 VBA began scanning claim folders and uploading the files into the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) for claims processors to view electronically as searchable Portable Document Files (PDFs). Scanning efforts expanded to mail in 2014 and scanning of historical file banks in 2016. The success of VBA s scanning program supported the reduction of rating claim backlogs from over 600,000 in early 2012 to less than 90,000 by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. Although the COVID-19 period limited the pace of reducing the backlog, progress continued until COVID limitations were lifted and the pace of claims increased such that the current inventory is more than 300,000. The scanning program also enabled the opportunity to further reduce the claim cycle by extracting data from images to automate business processes. The VBA continues to need contractor support for reducing the inventory. In today s process, mail arrives at the Evidence Intake Center from Veterans, or their representatives, to support a Veteran s, or their family member s, claim for benefits and services. This mail is tracked and converted into searchable PDF (PDF Image plus Text) format in compliance with the VBMS PDF specification. Also, as records are located or generated during claim development activities, they are retrieved and added to the body of evidence supporting the claim in the systems of records for the claimant. These materials typically support one or more business processes, primarily related to Veterans benefits claims processing, using other input material provided by other entities (such as VHA, NCA and other federal partners). The Veterans Intake, Conversion and Communication Services (VICCS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) was established in 2019 to continuously improve benefits processing efficiency and cycle-time. VBA has partnered with industry leaders to provide a host of managed-service contracts but the period of performance for the VICCS expires in September 2024, the VA will need a replacement IDIQ. This VA Processing and Automation Services (VPAS) IDIQ provides a successor replacement to the VICCS IDIQ to provide managed services for all elements of VA to provide the following categories of services: Source Material Processing Services, such as Intake Source Material Tracking Source Material Management Digitization and data extraction Upload and Routing Inbound Mail Management Support Rule-Based Processing (such Optical Character Recognition, Iterative Fusion based Recognizer, Natural Language Processing) Centralized Outbound Data Transfer Graphical Self-Service Report Generation Inbound Calls Outbound Calls Automation Development and Operations Business Process Automation Claims / Application processing Private medical records processing Mail automation Veteran transition support Records Research Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) / Privacy Act request processing Operations and Maintenance Integration Services, such as Organizational Integration Connectivity, Access, and Security Data Integration Automation Integration Integration Library Data Storage, Sharing and Analysis Services Customer/Employee Experience Services Enabling and Support Services, such as Business Processing Professional services Organizational Change Management Marketing/Outreach Communications Strategy, Planning, and Implementation Customer Relationship Services Case Management Services System Modernization and Retirement Services Training Services Integration, Setup, Test and Validation Services Service Updates Transition In/Out Help Desk / Call Center Services Requirements may fall within one specific service area but in many cases, the requirements will encompass and apply across and within multiple service areas. VBA anticipates continuing, enhancing and expanding the above referenced services through contractor support by means of ultimately competing this work among highly qualified and capable contractors. However, this RFI does not represent a solicitation nor is it a guarantee of a future solicitation.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) Operations Contract II (NOC II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to, support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA NOC, contract #80JSC017C0001. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology). Under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,000. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all categories of Large Business, Small Business (SB), all socioeconomic categories of Small Business and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (ED-WOSB) or HUB Zone business set-aside based on responses received. NOC II Description: The proposed NOC II contract will provide operational support services to the NBL. It is anticipated that the NOC II will be a single-award, Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Completion Form contract with an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity feature. The current NOC IDIQ feature represents approximately 30% of contract value, and it is anticipated that NOC II will maintain a similar percentage of IDIQ contract value. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee and/or Firm-Fixed-Price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the current NOC Statement of Work (SOW) and Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) are attached to this posting. NASA anticipates releasing the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs within several weeks. It is anticipated that there will be some changes between the NOC SOW and DRDs and the NOC II SOW and DRDs. Interested parties are encouraged to carefully review the draft NOC II SOW and DRDs for changes upon their release.   The NBL is a key Agency asset that supports human space flight training by simulating weightless and partial gravity environments through underwater diving operations. It provides capabilities for astronaut training, real-time mission troubleshooting, flight hardware development and verification, water survival training, and support of external customers. Because of the NBL’s importance to the NASA mission, and the highly hazardous operations performed there, the NBL has high-visibility to agency management and the general public. The NBL also includes a Logistics and Mockup Facility (LMF) that provides fabrication, repair, and maintenance of mockups. The NBL is operated by JSC’s Flight Operations Directorate (FOD). The NBL currently supports the International Space Station (ISS), Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, and Lunar Surface operations), other NASA space programs, and other JSC directorates (e.g. Engineering, Health and Human Performance, and Public Affairs). In addition to the JSC directorates, the NBL also supports other NASA field centers, other Government agencies (e.g. U.S. Coast Guard), and commercial companies. The support provided includes the use of the NBL for submerged and surface activities. The LMF is also available to provide hardware repairs or modifications to increase productivity in the NBL. The mockups used in the NBL are full-scale (1:1) models of spacecraft, spacecraft components, or lunar surface features. Depending on their purpose, mockups can vary from “low fidelity”, which models the basic volume and shape of the item, to “high fidelity” which very closely matches the “look and feel” of the item. Mockups can be built to last briefly (e.g. for short-term engineering evaluations) or for many years. NBL mockups are usually made from stainless steel, composites and plastics and are intended for multi-year use. JSC is eager to support and partner with the burgeoning Commercial Spaceflight Industry and recognizes that the NBL provides unique capabilities that may be helpful to many entities. NASA anticipates incentivizing the successful support of external customers but anticipates little to no active recruitment of new customers due to the expected high utilization of the NBL during the period of performance of NOC II. However, NASA wants to ensure that new customers can be recruited if utilization falls below expected levels. Note that NASA anticipates significant changes to the External Customer metrics and incentives under the NOC II requirement from those in the attached NOC SOW and DRDs. The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: Raytheon Company Contract Number: 80JSC017C0001 Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $160M Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2024 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: 1.

The JSC Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the NOC II acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the NOC II may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA’s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for NOC II. Specifically, NASA anticipates the effort under NOC II will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Provide assessments of the safety or readiness of commercial suit vendors to integrate and perform testing in the NBL Potential access to data from other commercial companies or government agencies acquired through integrating and assessing the safety of hardware put into the NBL for testing, training, or evaluation Potential access to assessment data for hardware tested, trained, or evaluated in the NBL Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated NOC II contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the NOC II contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government procurement contract Potential impaired objectivity if the NOC II contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g. affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA’s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf    Please reference this document for additional information about NASA’s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the NOC II contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed NOC II contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the NOC II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential NOC II Request for Proposal (RFP)? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror’s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. Companies are cautioned to consider OCI when responding to this RFI, and to consider internal mitigation measures that would prevent OCI from adversely affecting a company’s future procurement prospects. NASA is not in a position to respond to Offerors on the existence of OCI or remedial measures. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Offerors will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its OCI submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP.   Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for NOC II.   Additionally, in support of EO 13985, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of \"equity.\" Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. NASA seeks input in the following areas: To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g. outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it.

      "Sample 1: NASA’s Technology Transfer Program solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA's Langley Research Center offers a novel lifting and precision positioning device with hybrid functional characteristics of both crane-type lifting devices and robotic manipulators. The design of the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS) allows for fine positioning with complete control over both translation and rotation of the payload. In addition, the design permits several other operations using a wide variety of special purpose tools, such as a bucket, pallet forks, grappling devices, sensor and visualization packages, and dexterous robotic arms that can be quickly added to the tip. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees. NASA Langley developed the LSMS because of the need for a versatile system capable of performing multiple functions on the lunar surface, such as unloading components from a lander, transporting components to an operational site and installing them, and supporting service and replacement during component life. Current devices used for in-space operations are designed to work on orbit (zero g) only and thus do not have sufficient strength to operate on planetary surfaces. Traditional cranes are specialized to the task of lifting and are not capable of manipulator-type positioning operations. The innovations incorporated into the LSMS allow it to lower payloads to the ground over a significant portion of the workspace without use of a hoist, functioning like a robot manipulator, thus providing a rigid connection and very precise control of the payload. The LSMS uses a truss architecture with pure compression and tension members to achieve a lightweight design. The innovation of using multiple spreaders (like spokes in a wheel) allows the LSMS to maintain its high structural efficiency throughout its full range of motion. Rod portions of the tension members automatically lift off and re-engage the spreaders as the joint articulates, allowing a large range of motion while maintaining mechanical advantage. In addition, the LSMS uses a quick-change device at the tip end that enables automated acquisition of end effectors or special purpose tools to increase its versatility.

      "Sample 4: NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information from potential partners to participate in a proposal development activity that will design, develop, build, and ground demonstrate autonomous assembly of multiple sub-scale radiator modules with fluidic, mechanical, and electrical interfaces for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) vehicles. Modular Assembled Radiators for NEP Vehicle (MARVL) project is an Early Career Initiative (ECI) sponsored by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and was released on March 1, 2023. The deadline for partnering responses is April 27, 2023. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) LaRC is seeking participation with this partnering synopsis from all interested U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are also encouraged to apply. Additionally, in support of the Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is also looking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities to access procurement opportunities. Underserved Communities include Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASA’s policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. The Early Career Initiative is an internal NASA call for space technology development and demonstration proposals that foster the next step in the professional development of early career NASA technologists by providing cutting-edge hands-on space technology hardware development opportunities.  This initiative promotes creative joint partnering within highly collaborative work environments between the best and brightest NASA early career innovators and while teaming with world-class industry, academia, and other government organizations.  Proposing teams will include a core team, including NASA and external partner members and at least half of the core team must consist of NASA early career employees.  A NASA early career employee must lead the project (Project Lead) and shall engage an experienced NASA mentor, and a STMD mentor who will be identified after selection of the project.  Other roles (e.g., Project Manager, Project Scientist) can be filled by team members from NASA or partner.  The general approach will be to employ agile systems engineering methods emphasizing working products, collaboration, iterative, hands-on testing, and responsiveness to change rather than formal process and documentation with milestone-based assessments including a continuation review at the development site and a final presentation to NASA Headquarters.  If a project wishes to involve a foreign organization, prior confirmation is needed.  Teams must propose innovative space hardware-focused projects lasting no more than 2 years and costing up to $1.25M per year in total (25-45% for external partners) for all cost including procurement and labor.   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners to participate in developing proposals for and collaborating on potential Early Career Initiative (ECI) projects. LaRC is pursuing several topic areas that align with NASA’s space technology priorities and involve a variety of technical areas that could benefit from partnering. The partner can propose to the technical challenge provided below: Long duration space flight is a requirement for missions to both the Moon and Mars. One candidate for propulsion is Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). This form of propulsion generates high levels of heat and requires large scale radiators. NEP vehicles have the potential to be on the same size order or larger than the International Space Station (ISS).  The required radiating area, based on current mission requirements, will be the largest proposed space structure even conceived at around 2500 m2 (an order of magnitude larger than the radiating area on the ISS).  The large radiator size required for NEP vehicles negates the feasibility of utilizing conventional deployable radiator designs and will also greatly exceed current launch vehicle volumetric capacities. An alternate method to assemble structures of this size is to explore autonomous in-space assembly of modular units. Development of modular autonomously assembled radiators would not only advance NEP vehicle concepts but is also extensible to a multitude of other space and surface-based applications. The Modular Assembly Radiators for NEP VehicLes (MARVL) ECI project will address both the required design and in-space assembly, with a focus on autonomous assembly, of a potential radiator design. The project will conduct research and development efforts into radiator design for a candidate NEP vehicle. The team will then design small-scale modular units that can be assembled to produce the size radiator that is needed. The units will then be simplified for use in a ground demonstration of a modular assembled radiator. Utilization of prior knowledge of autonomous assembly or robotic assembly will be crucial for project success. This work will also include development in fluid loop and reversable coupler technology with focus on autonomous assembly. The following objectives will be addressed by the program: Investigate the trade space for an NEP vehicle with in-space assembled radiators and propose configurations Design and develop a radiator module for in-space assembly Investigate and determine fluid/mechanical/electric coupler connection between radiator modules Develop and concept of operations for autonomous in-space assembled radiators Perform relevant subscale demonstration of autonomous in-space assembled radiator Develop autonomous leak checking and verification of connections The partner must provide expertise in at least one of the fields described below and must have the personnel and facilities required to perform any necessary software or hardware testing. The ideal partner may also contribute some, but not all, work or resources to the project in-kind, which should be described within the partner’s proposal submission. Ideal academic partner candidates should have experience in the fields of heat rejection systems, radiator design, autonomy, robotics and/or software development with personnel and facilities required to develop and test the autonomy packages using relevant hardware developed among partners. Ideal industry partner candidates should also have experience in heat rejection systems, radiator design fluid loop development, reversable fluid coupler design, autonomy, in-space assembly, and/or modular design. Knowledge in fluid loop radiator technology and build will also be desired.   This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) technical requirements, conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, and cost estimates. If the proposal is subsequently selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selected partner(s) for the performance of the proposed tasks. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria: Technical Qualifications of the External Partner (30 points): This criterion evaluates the technical expertise/capabilities; and innovativeness of the external partner in leading and/or executing activities related to the topics above; and the resources (skills and time) that would be allocated to the potential proposal development phase.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION The High Performance Computing and Visualization Group (HPCVG), is located in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Division (ACMD) in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Group develops novel algorithms and implementations for parallel and distributed computation, as well as innovative techniques for immersive scientific visualization in a variety of local and distributed hardware environments. They also develop and utilize techniques and tools of mathematical analysis, parallel and distributed computing, machine learning, and visualization to improve measurement science, including the extension of traditional measurement science to the virtual world. This is all in support of the NIST mission: “To promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.” HPCVG owns and operates a CAVE (CAVE Automatic Visualization Environment) for its immersive visualization work at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD site.  A CAVE is a real-time hardware system that enables the user to see perspective-based true 3D images. For this to function correctly, the hardware system must be designed with real-time capability that enables viewing of real-time images. This Immersive Visualization Environment (IVE), along with the software that the Group develops, is on a critical path for all research in the Group. Its role is critical in HPCVG’s High Performance Computing work as it serves to speed code development and enable quick checking for errors as well as validation tests. It enables the visualization, measurement on visualizations, and analysis of results. This has led to solving critical outstanding problems in industry and contributing to the creation of standard reference materials and data. For example, it played a crucial role in the development of the standard reference materials for cement paste, mortar, and concrete. The CAVE has come to the end of its life as the display system can no longer be maintained. In order to ensure continuity of research efforts and to keep pace with the rapid advancement of technology in this area, it is important that the IVE be upgraded. NIST requires an upgrade to the IVE/CAVE on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus with newer display technology. Higher resolution and more complex data visualizations require a higher resolution and brighter display system with collaborative visualization capability. NIST has identified that a Direct View Light Emitting Diodes (LED) display system would offer a higher resolution and brighter display compared to its existing projection-based visualization system. Furthermore, a Direct View LED system would also be able to support dual view stereoscopic visualization where both users would have their own unique view angle of the visualization.  Thus, NIST a dual-view display system, as described in the attached Specifications.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED; AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT (I.E. STANDARD FORM) WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURES FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2024-03. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the requirement is 334310 – Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 750 employees. This is a 100% small business set-aside. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized. Note: The Small Business Administration (SBA) maintains an active non-manufacturer rule class waiver for the aforementioned NAICS code. BACKGROUND INFORMATION The High Performance Computing and Visualization Group (HPCVG), is located in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Division (ACMD) in the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Group develops novel algorithms and implementations for parallel and distributed computation, as well as innovative techniques for immersive scientific visualization in a variety of local and distributed hardware environments. They also develop and utilize techniques and tools of mathematical analysis, parallel and distributed computing, machine learning, and visualization to improve measurement science, including the extension of traditional measurement science to the virtual world. This is all in support of the NIST mission: “To promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.” HPCVG owns and operates a CAVE (CAVE Automatic Visualization Environment) for its immersive visualization work at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD site.  A CAVE is a real-time hardware system that enables the user to see perspective-based true 3D images. For this to function correctly, the hardware system must be designed with real-time capability that enables viewing of real-time images. This Immersive Visualization Environment (IVE), along with the software that the Group develops, is on a critical path for all research in the Group. Its role is critical in HPCVG’s High Performance Computing work as it serves to speed code development and enable quick checking for errors as well as validation tests. It enables the visualization, measurement on visualizations, and analysis of results. This has led to solving critical outstanding problems in industry and contributing to the creation of standard reference materials and data. For example, it played a crucial role in the development of the standard reference materials for cement paste, mortar, and concrete. The CAVE has come to the end of its life as the display system can no longer be maintained. In order to ensure continuity of research efforts and to keep pace with the rapid advancement of technology in this area, it is important that the IVE be upgraded. NIST requires an upgrade to the IVE/CAVE on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD campus with newer display technology. Higher resolution and more complex data visualizations require a higher resolution and brighter display system with collaborative visualization capability. NIST has identified that a Direct View Light Emitting Diodes (LED) display system would offer a higher resolution and brighter display compared to its existing projection-based visualization system. Furthermore, a Direct View LED system would also be able to support dual view stereoscopic visualization where both users would have their own unique view angle of the visualization.  Thus, NIST a dual-view display system, as described in the attached Specifications.

Best value shall be determined using the trade-off evaluation method. Therefore, the Government may award to other than the lowest priced quote or the highest technically rated quoter. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and issue a purchase order based on the initial quotations received.  Therefore, the quoter’s initial quotation should contain the quoter’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to request revised quotations from, or negotiate final purchase order terms with one or more, but not all, quoters if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all quotations if the quotation fails to comply with the requirements of this solicitation. The factors identified below will be used to evaluate quotations. Factor A (Technical Factor):  Technical Approach Factor B (Technical Factor):  Key Personnel Factor C (Technical Factor):  Past Performance Factor D (Non-Technical Factor): Price Technical / non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. Technical / non-price factors, when combined, are more important than price.  However, price will become more important as the degree of equality among technical non-price evaluations increases. A.       Technical Approach The Government will evaluate the quoter’s technical approach and capabilities for performing each task in the Performance Work Statement. The technical approach will be evaluated for the quoter’s overall understanding of and capability to complete the Government requirements, as well as the expected effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Relevancy shall be considered similarity to the current requirement in scope of work, period of performance, and total dollar value. The government will consider past performance on efforts completed or substantially completed within the past five (5) years. References may be contacted and the Government may consider past performance information from other sources, such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  D.       Price Quoted pricing will be evaluated but not scored.

The associated NAICS code for this is 339112. The vendor will be Howmedica Osteonics Corp, 325 Corporate Drive, Mahwah, NJ 07430. REQUIREMENT: The MAKO Robotic Arm System (3 App) Total Knee/Partial Knee/Total Hip: 1 RIO Surgical Arm 1 RIO Guidance Module 1 RIO Camera Stand Assembly 1 RIO Accessory Kit 1 ROBOT Utilities 1.11.1 Software Disk 1 MAKO User Guide 5 Mako Power Trays 1 MAKOplasty CT Scan Kit MAKO Total Knee Application: 1 Mako Total Knee Software License 2 Mako Knee Trays 2 Pelvic Arrays 2 Stryker Leg Positioner Tray Kids 1 Surgeon and Surgical Staff Training, Total Knee Mako Partial Knee Application: 1 RESTORIS Partial Knewe Software License 2 Mako Knee Trays 2 IMP DeMayo Leg Positioner 25 Kits 1 Surgeon & Surgical Staff Training, Knee Mako Total Hip Application: 1 MAKOplasty Total Hip Software License 2 Mako Hip Instrument Kits 2 Mako THA Array Kits 2 Hip End Effector, Variable Angle 1 Surgeon & Surgical Staff Training, Hip There are several features/characteristics of the Mako system, as well as other reasons, which establish it as the only system to satisfy the Government s needs: 1. Mako is a semi-active system. The Mako robotic arm will guide the surgeon to precise bone cuts in total knee replacement. The surgeon utilizes a saw attached to a robotic arm. The robotic arm will have a defined area of resection based on the preoperative CT scan performed. This will minimize the potential for soft tissue injury such as neurovascular injury, ligamentous injury, or tendon injury. The robotic arm will not allow the surgeon to make cuts beyond the defined area of resection established by the preoperative CT scan. After a thorough surgical plan is created and approved by the surgeon, the Mako system assists surgeons with executing that plan using AccuStop haptic technology. The implant position, tracking and soft tissue balancing are assessed in a virtual 3D model by combining a preoperative CT and intraoperative bone registration. A CT scan uses a combination of 2D and digital geometry processing to generate a 3D image of the body. While plain film radiographs (X-rays) provide a 2D image of the scanned area, anatomic structures may overlap, creating an image which is less detailed than a CT scan. In a CT image, overlapping structures are eliminated, making the internal anatomy easier to visualize. In knee and hip arthroplasty procedures, the femoral version and tibial torsion 76 can provide critical guidance when planning a case. Bony anatomic landmarks of the femur and tibia can be clearly identified using 3D imaging technologies. After the surgeon assesses implant size and position in the preoperative plan, the robotic arm is introduced to the surgical site. The robotic arm uses AccuStop haptic technology to help ensure only the desired bone is resected. The robotic arm will give resistance, an audible warning and ultimately turn off if the surgeon attempts to move the cutting tool on the robotic arm outside the boundaries created in the preoperative plan. In addition, when the surgeon prepares the bone for the implant, the robotic arm guides the surgeon within the predefined area, allowing for a more accurate and better-aligned knee. The Mako system 1) provides the surgeon real-time sensory feedback, 2) places the surgeon in complete control, 3) helps ensure proper preparation of the bone 4) allows for precise placement of the implant, 5) produces minimal blood loss and a smaller scar, 6) helps preserve healthy bone and soft tissue, 7) results in less post-operative pain than manual techniques, and 8) provides a quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay. 2. The Mako robotic arm is FDA-approved for both cemented and non-cemented total knee replacement. The trend in current orthopedic surgery is toward the use of non-cemented components to allow bone ingrowth into the knee prosthesis and reduce the incidence of bone -cement interface failure with subsequent loosening and need for revision surgery. It is beneficial especially for the younger and more active patients. 3. The Mako system is utilized as a semi-active system for total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and total hip replacement. The system will guide the surgeon in performing bone cuts in total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and in acetabular reaming in total hip replacement. The major competitors of the Mako system do not provide robotic assistance in the performance of hip replacement. The Mako system provides direct surgeon assistance in the placement of the acetabular component by directing the surgeon through the use of a robotic arm in reaming of the acetabulum. The ideal placement of the acetabular cup is determined by the preoperative CT scan and allows for placement of the acetabular cup to reduce the potential for dislocation, optimize the leg length, and minimize the potential for impingement of the femur on the acetabulum. In addition, because the size of the acetabular cup can be determined from the preoperative CT scan, reaming of the acetabulum is minimized, Typically in a traditional hip replacement without the use of computer navigation, the acetabulum is enlarged progressively by 1-2mm increments until the ideal size is obtained, usually based on the size of the femoral head measured at the time of surgery, With the MAKO system, the size of the acetabular cup is determined preoperatively and a single reaming is performed with the predetermined acetabular size based on the pre operative CT scan. This can significantly reduce operative time. In addition, since the placement of the acetabular cup is directed by the robotic arm, the MAKO system allows for the precise placement of the acetabular cup determined by preoperative planning. This will reduce the incidence of cup malposition and associated complications including post op dislocation, premature polyethylene wear, leg length discrepancy, and impingement. 4. Stryker Mako robotic arm was requested for use at the Detroit VA to assist in joint replacement procedures - specifically total hip replacement and total knee replacement. Currently, the three orthopedic surgeons who perform hip and knee replacement surgery use Stryker instrumentation and implants to perform total joint replacement. The Mako robotic arm would be an extension of the instrumentation currently utilized to perform hip and knee replacement at the Detroit VA. Should a problem occur with the robot utilization, the procedure would need to be converted to the traditional type of open procedure which the facility currently performs, utilizing the various instrumentation available for intramedullary and/or extra medullary alignment, bone cuts, prosthetic trials, and prosthesis insertion. The Mako robot was designed to be used with Stryker components. Any of the surgeons utilizing the Mako robotic arm would easily be able to switch to a traditional approach currently used should the need arise. Each company that manufactures prosthetic components supplies their own instrumentation to allow for the appropriate placement of the final prosthesis. The instrumentation utilized for joint replacement can be extensive, and typically 5 or more trays of instruments and prosthetic trials are used during joint replacement. Utilizing a robot system other than the Mako system would not be compatible with the current system for which the three orthopedic surgeons performing joint replacement are currently familiar. To switch from the current system would require retraining of the current orthopedic surgeons performing joint replacement to become familiar with an entirely new system for alignment, bone cuts, and prosthesis insertion. This would be absolutely necessary since there is always a risk of robot failure and the need to convert the robotic-assisted procedure into a traditional instrument-guided procedure. There is a learning curve associated with switching to a new system and during that time procedures would take longer to perform, and patients may be subject to a higher rate of adverse event, which is not in the patient s best interest. Each system has its own nuances and experience using a system helps to provide a more fluid surgical procedure, reduce operative time, and minimize errors during the surgical procedure. In summary, the Mako robotic system will meet the clinical needs of the Detroit VA. It is the only system that will provide robotic assistance in the performance of both total hip and total knee replacement. There are other systems available that do not provide robotic assistance of total hip replacement. In addition, preoperative evaluation with use of CT scan in hip replacement has the potential to reduce operative times by limiting the amount of reaming to prepare the native acetabulum for placement of the prosthetic cup. The Mako robotic system is a product of Stryker. There are no other companies that produce this specific product. There are other companies that produce computer navigation or robotic arms for joint replacement, however, the Mako robotic system is FDA-approved for total knee replacement both cemented and non-cemented total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and total hip replacement.

Mako SmartRobotics possesses several key features that differentiate it from other surgery platforms. After a thorough surgical plan is created and approved by the surgeon, the Mako System assists surgeons with executing that plan using AccuStop haptic technology. The implant position, tracking and soft tissue balancing are assessed in a virtual 3D model by combining a preoperative CT and intraoperative bone registration. A CT scan uses a combination of 2D and digital geometry processing to generate a 3D image of the body. While plain film radiographs (X-rays) provide a 2D image of the scanned area, anatomic structures may overlap, creating an image which is less detailed than a CT scan. In a CT image, overlapping structures are eliminated, making the internal anatomy easier to visualize. In knee and hip arthroplasty procedures, the femoral version and tibial torsion76 can provide critical guidance when planning a case. Bony anatomic landmarks of the femur and tibia can be clearly identified using 3D imaging technologies. After the surgeon assesses implant size and position in the preoperative plan, the robotic arm is introduced to the surgical site. The robotic arm uses AccuStop haptic technology to help ensure only the desired bone is resected. The robotic arm will give resistance, an audible warning and ultimately turn off if the surgeon attempts to move the cutting tool on the robotic arm outside the boundaries created in the preoperative plan.

      "8     INL Innovation Spotlight Cyber Resilient Trade-off Evaluation (CyRTE): Pioneering Strategy for Operational Technology Security CyRTE introduces a groundbreaking approach to evaluate and enhance the cyber resilience of Operational Technologies (OT), balancing security measures with operational integrity. Overview:         As critical infrastructure increasingly relies on networked control systems, they become vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional cybersecurity measures, while necessary, often fall short in protecting OT systems effectively. CyRTE is developed in response to this challenge, providing a resilience-informed, AI-driven process to assess the impact of cybersecurity mitigations on the operation and stability of OT systems. This technology is essential for evaluating automated responses in advance of application, leveraging the power of software defined networks and other response technologies that can nullify an intrusion. Industries where operational technology is critical, such as utilities, manufacturing, and transport, will be benefited in advancing cyber resilience, especially in a landscape where cyber threats are rapidly evolving and becoming more automated. Description:    CyRTE offers a novel methodology for assessing cyber-physical interactions and their implications on OT systems. It involves a comprehensive evaluation of potential cybersecurity mitigations and their effects on system performance and reliability. The core of CyRTE is the creation of a \"buzzer\" concept – a unique tool that systematically tests the resilience of OT systems against various cyber-physical response strategies. This includes the development of digital twins for systemic testing, ensuring that cybersecurity measures do not adversely affect the physical operations of the system before application. By integrating this approach into existing engineering workstations and design tools, CyRTE enables a holistic understanding of communication dependencies...\n",

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 36C10G24R0012 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2024-01, dated 14 November 2023. Requirement Description: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Non-Expendable Equipment (NX) National Program has identified the Orthopedic Surgical Robotic Systems product line as a candidate for inclusion in the National Equipment Catalog (NEC). This will be accomplished via the awarding of a single award Requirements contract. Orthopedic Surgical Robotic Systems were developed to facilitate minimally invasive surgery to ultimately help surgeons perform procedures more consistently and accurately than with manual techniques. The first robot intended for orthopedic surgery was developed in the early 1990's to aid hip replacements. Current orthopedic surgical robots are used for knee and/or hip replacements. A single award Requirements contract will be awarded IAW FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications, and schedule of this solicitation herein.

The purpose of this SS is to conduct Market Research to determine an acquisition strategy, to include determining if there are a sufficient number of Small Businesses capable of performing the requirements to warrant a set-aside, for the procurement of bronchoscopes at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (CLE VAMC), 10701 East Blvd., Cleveland, OH 44106. Mako SmartRobotics possesses several key features that differentiate it from other surgery platforms. After a thorough surgical plan is created and approved by the surgeon, the Mako System assists surgeons with executing that plan using AccuStop haptic technology. The implant position, tracking and soft tissue balancing are assessed in a virtual 3D model by combining a preoperative CT and intraoperative bone registration. A CT scan uses a combination of 2D and digital geometry processing to generate a 3D image of the body. While plain film radiographs (X-rays) provide a 2D image of the scanned area, anatomic structures may overlap, creating an image which is less detailed than a CT scan. In a CT image, overlapping structures are eliminated, making the internal anatomy easier to visualize. In knee and hip arth...\n",

This position is designated as remote-work eligible. The Information Integrity and Resilience Advisor would serve as a subject matter expert and exercise technical leadership to bring innovative and evidence-based approaches to strengthen information integrity and resilience. This position provides critical, cutting-edge technical leadership in the field of information integrity and resilience. This includes in-depth knowledge of media programs with an understanding how technology, including Artificial Intelligence, can both facilitate and mitigate information disorder, what drives that diffusion (i.e. group identity, cognitive bias) and how that diffusion exacerbates social polarization which corrodes the foundation of democratic consensus building and collective solution finding. The Advisor is expected to work to advance research and learning, evidence-based approaches and promising and novel experimentation in this space to advise USAID Mission teams and Washington on state-of-the-art research and programming bolstering information resilience and integrity. At the core of this position is the ability to support USAID Missions to implement programs that address information disorder by pulling from cutting edge lessons learned cross-sectoral from health to countering violent extremism with democracy, human rights, and governance considerations being the core driver.

       "2755  USAID intends to issue a solicitation for a Personal Services Contract (PSC) for the position Information Integrity and Resilience (IIR) Advisor, GS-14 grade equivalent, for USAID’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG), Office of Global Trends and Technology (GTT). This position is designated as remote-work eligible. The Information Integrity and Resilience Advisor would serve as a subject matter expert and exercise technical leadership to bring innovative and evidence-based approaches to strengthen information integrity and resilience. This position provides critical, cutting-edge technical leadership in the field of information integrity and resilience. This includes in-depth knowledge of media programs with an understanding how technology, including Artificial Intelligence, can both facilitate and mitigate information disorder, what drives that diffusion (i.e. group identity, cognitive bias) and how that diffusion exacerbates social polarization which corrodes the foundation of democratic consensus building and collective solution finding. The Advisor is expected to work to advance research and learning, evidence-based approaches and promising and novel experimentation in this space to advise USAID Mission teams and Washington on state-of-the-art research and programming bolstering information resilience and integrity. At the core of this position is the ability to support USAID Missions to implement programs that address information disorder by pulling from cutting edge lessons learned cross-sectoral from health to countering violent extremism with democracy, human rights, and governance considerations being the core driver.
